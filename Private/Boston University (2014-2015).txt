TIPS FOR ENSURING YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY:
	•	Always be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. When parking, walking or returning to your car, remain in well-lit and populated areas.
	•	Wear sneakers or shoes that allow for added mobility.
	•	Be watchful and aware. Keep your head up. Make quick eye contact with those around you and be observant of passing vehicles. Don’t become distracted by talking on a cell phone or listening to an iPod/similar device.
	•	Avoid walking alone late at night. Walk with friends and people you know.
	•	Keep a whistle within reach. If you feel threatened, use the whistle to signal residents that you need assistance. Yelling “Fire!” “Help!” and/or “Rape!” are other ways of drawing attention and alerting people that you need help.
	•	Hold your car keys in your hand to use as a weapon against an attacker.
	•	Carry a cell phone.
	•	Call ahead to your destination to alert them that you’re on your way. Make sure they expect you at a certain time, so that in the event you fail to show up, they’ll know enough to begin looking for you.
	•	Walk with confidence. Be assertive. Don’t let anyone violate your space. Trust your instincts. Know this: anyone at any time can be a victim of crime. Don’t assume, “IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO ME.”
	•	If an unarmed attacker confronts you, believe in your ability to scare, distract, or even incapacitate the attacker enough to escape.
	•	If you think that someone is following you, switch direction or cross the street. Walk toward an open store, restaurant, or residence.

Phishing emails sent to bu.edu accounts requesting passwords
Recently there have been a series of phishing emails sent to email accounts in the bu.edu system that claim the recipient's mailbox has exceeded its storage limit. These fraudulent emails, claiming to be on behalf of the BU system administrator and/or BU Human Resources, contain a link with a request for the recipient's email password. The email system was exploited a year ago in a similar phishing scheme in which passwords were requested to the recipient's BU Works account for purposes of updating payroll records. The University does not send emails which contain requests for user names and/or passwords. Any email requesting you to click on a link to increase email storage or update/change payroll records should be considered suspect. Do not click on links and do not provide any information requested. These emails should be forwarded to BU Information Services and Technology (IS&T) at abuse@bu.edu for further advice. Information on reporting suspicious emails can be found at:http://www.bu.edu/tech/services/comm/email/unwanted-email/report-abuse/

Security Breaches. What to do when your favorite store or site gets hacked.
BU Information Security Presents: Security Breaches. What to do when your favorite store or site gets hacked. Security breaches are becoming more and more common. Recently JP Morgan, Home Depot, Goodwill, and Google have been in the news for security breaches. It is important for you to know what you should do in the event that a store where you have shopped has a security breach. If credit card information has been stolen from the store, monitor your credit card statement and your credit report. You can get one free credit report from each of the three main agencies every year by going to [ annualcreditreport.com ]. Keeping an eye on these reports can help you detect if your identity or one of your financial accounts is being used fraudulently. If you have an account with a website that has been breached, you need to change that password. If you have used that same password on any other site, change it there, too. Always make sure you understand what information you are giving to these companies and think about what it might mean if the site is hacked. This includes posting pictures and other personal information. We keep hearing about celebrity photos being stolen from online accounts - what do you have online? What if Facebook were hacked tomorrow? Password management is increasingly crucial. Don’t use your BU password anywhere else. Same for your email; don’t use that password anywhere else. In fact, it is best to use a different password for every account; that way if one website becomes compromised, it won’t impact others. The easiest way to do this is to use a password management tool, which allows you to remember one password and automatically keeps track of all your other passwords for you. Links to some of these password management tools are listed below. A list of recent data breaches: [ databreachtoday.com/news ] How to pick a good password: [ bu.edu/infosec/howtos/how-to-choose-a-password/ ] Some respected password management tools: • LastPass [ lastpass.com ] • 1Password [ agilebits.com/onepassword ] Tomorrow: Harden your accounts against hackers. Make it so that there is more than just a password between the bad guys and your sensitive stuff.

Scam Alert
A BU student was likely the victim of a scam yesterday when the student parted with $100 to help the nicely dressed gentleman who needed the money for a cab to get to an important meeting because his car had a flat tire. Over the last several years BU students have been victimized by scam artists posing as a person in distress and needing a large amount of cash. Appealing to the students' good nature the suspect, usually well-dressed and polite, requests money needed urgently due to some sort of emergency, usually due to a car accident or broken down car. The suspect then offers to go with the unsuspecting victim to the nearest ATM. While it is not the desire of the BUPD to interfere with acts of kindness and compassion there are certain patterns of behavior that should put you on notice of the possibility that your good nature is being exploited. Requests for large amounts of cash from a stranger on the street is one of those situations. We recommend you refrain from parting with your money in these situations and report the incident as soon as possible to the BUPD (617-353-2121) if it occurs in or around the campus. If the person is truly in need of assistance we can provide them with help.

***Green Dot MoneyPak Scam Targets Foreign Students***
***Green Dot MoneyPak Scam Targets Foreign Students*** Recently a BU foreign student received a phone call from a person claiming to be from the IRS who threatened the student would be arrested and deported if more than $1200 was not paid immediately by providing the caller the account number from a Green Dot MoneyPak card. A hour later the student received another call, this time from a person claiming to be an immigration officer, who demanded nearly $700 paid immediately by Green Dot MoneyPak to clear up arrest warrants for the student. The student complied with these demands and now has lost nearly two thousand dollars to this scam. Green Dot MoneyPak cards are essentially pre-paid debit cards purchased at retailers that can be used to put money into a PayPal account or pre-paid credit card account or can be used to make payments to certain retailers who accept Green Dot MoneyPak cards. Once you provide a person with the 12-digit account number from the card, that person can immediately apply all funds on the card to their own pre-paid credit cards and your money is lost. These cards present an attractive method for scammers to siphon money from unsuspecting victims because it allows them to direct instant cash payments from the victim over the telephone. The are many variations to this fraudulent scheme including callers claiming to be from utility companies or callers claiming that a relative of the victim is in distress and needs immediate help. You should be aware that the telephone numbers used by the scammers are frequently "spoofed" meaning that the telephone call is made from the internet via voice over internet protocol (VoIP) where the caller can create the number that shows up on your caller ID. You should never provide Green Dot card number to a stranger. If you are being extorted based on the money needed for a relative or other person you know, try to stall the caller an contact the police for help. Government officials and utility company officials will never contact you by telephone and demand a payment made by Green Dot MoneyPak card. Any unsolicited telephone calls you receive where payment is demanded using Green Dot cards or by wire transfer are highly suspect and you should contact the police for advice.

Treasury Inspector General Urges Taxpayers to Be on "High Alert" to Phone Fraud Scam
J. Russell George Urges Taxpayers to Be on "High Alert" to Phone Fraud Scam TIGTA Reminds Taxpayers to Beware of Calls from IRS Impersonators this Filing Season WASHINGTON — As the 2015 tax filing season begins, the Treasury Inspector General for Taxpayer Administration (TIGTA) is reminding taxpayers to beware of phone calls from individuals claiming to represent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in an effort to defraud them. “It is critical that all taxpayers continue to be wary of unsolicited telephone calls from individuals claiming to be IRS employees,” said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. “This scam, which is international in nature, has proven to be the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen. The callers are aggressive, they are relentless and they are ruthless,” he said. “Once they have your attention, they will say anything to con you out of your hard-earned cash,” George added. TIGTA has received reports of roughly 290,000 contacts since October 2013 and has become aware of nearly 3,000 victims who have collectively paid over $14 million as a result of the scam, in which individuals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials and demanding that they send them cash via prepaid debit cards. “The increasing number of people not only receiving but accepting these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming,” George said. “At all times, and particularly during the tax filing season, we want to make sure that innocent taxpayers are alert to this scam so they are not harmed by these criminals,” he said, adding, “Do not become a victim.” “This is a crime of opportunity, so the best thing you can do to protect yourself is to take away the opportunity,” the Inspector General added. “Do not engage with these callers. If they call you, hang up the telephone.” Inspector General George noted that the scam has hit taxpayers in every State in the country. Callers claiming to be from the IRS tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with immediate arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license. The IRS usually first contacts people by mail – not by phone – about unpaid taxes. And the IRS won’t ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The IRS also won’t ask for a credit card number over the phone. “If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” George said. The callers who commit this fraud often: • Utilize an automated robocall machine. • Use common names and fake IRS badge numbers. • May know the last four digits of the victim’s Social Security Number. • Make caller ID information appear as if the IRS is calling. • Send bogus IRS e-mails to support their scam. • Call a second or third time claiming to be the police or department of motor vehicles, and the caller ID again supports their claim. If you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS asking for a payment, here’s what to do: • If you owe Federal taxes, or think you might owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with your payment questions. • If you don’t owe taxes, fill out the “IRS Impersonation scam” form on TIGTA’s website, www.treasury.gov/tigta or call TIGTA at 800-366-4484. • You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov. Add “IRS Telephone Scam" to the comments in your complaint. TIGTA and the IRS encourage taxpayers to be alert for phone and e-mail scams that use the IRS name. The IRS will never request personal or financial information by e-mail, texting or any social media. You should forward scam e-mails to phishing@irs.gov. Don’t open any attachments or click on any links in those e-mails. Taxpayers should be aware that there are other unrelated scams (such as a lottery sweepstakes winner) and solicitations (such as debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be from the IRS. Read more about tax scams on the genuine IRS website at www.irs.gov.

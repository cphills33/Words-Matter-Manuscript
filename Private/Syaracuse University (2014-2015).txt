Public Safety Update, 12/10/2014
DECEMBER 10, 2014 • BY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
This past weekend, the Syracuse University Department of Public Safety (DPS) issued a “Public Safety Notice” bulletin regarding a report of a physical harassment that occurred at the Newhouse complex on Friday, Dec. 5.
The victim of this incident was a SU alumna who traveled to Syracuse to meet a male individual for what appeared to be a job interview with a local law firm. The victim had previously been solicited by, and exchanged emails with this individual and the proposed job interview appeared to likely be legitimate.
Upon arriving at the agreed upon meeting location at the Newhouse complex, the victim got an uneasy feeling when she met the suspect and asked if they could conduct the interview in the hallway and not in a meeting room. Subsequent to that, the suspect punched her twice in the face causing her to fall and causing a laceration to her lip.
The victim fled to an area in Newhouse 1 and notified people who were in the building. The victim indicated the suspect fled in the opposite direction, exiting Newhouse II. At this time there remain no witnesses reporting seeing the perpetrator. DPS continues to actively investigate this incident in cooperation with the City of Syracuse Police Department, and will report any significant developments to the campus community.
In addition, we have received some additional reports of general, online mass “phishing” scam attempts that include unsolicited offers for job opportunities and job interviews. With this in mind, the Department of Public Safety, in partnership with the University’s Office of Career Services, asks that all members of the Syracuse University community please consider the following regarding job interview offers:
Be very suspicious of unsolicited offers for job interviews. Unsolicited contacts from persons who claim to have found your information on social media sites like LinkedIn should be carefully reviewed prior to offering any response. They are far more often “phishing scams” than actual job opportunities.

Public Safety Update 11/11/2015
NOVEMBER 11, 2015 • BY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
Yik Yak Threat Incident and Arrest
On 28 October 2015, DPS received a report regarding a post on the Yik Yak app. There have been reports by media and law enforcement that individuals sometimes use Yik Yak to post threats, public alarm posts, or annoying posts because the sender believes they are anonymous.
The app shows posts made within a 10-mile radius of the sender, and the post is available for a limited amount of time before being taken down. The student who reported this incident was very alarmed by a post on Yik Yak and notified DPS. DPS detectives were able to collaborate with Yik Yak, other law enforcement entities, and SU’s ITS team to identify the individual, a former student who resides in the City of Syracuse.
The individual was arrested and charged. DPS takes any and all threats against the University community very seriously and was able to end this incident with a safe and positive outcome. Our hope is that individuals who believe they can remain anonymous while posting comments on public websites for unlawful purposes will end this practice with the knowledge that they are not able to remain anonymous.
To report threatening content on anonymous platforms like Yik Yak, call the Department of Public Safety at 315-443- 2224, or text or email the DPS at 711@syr.edu.

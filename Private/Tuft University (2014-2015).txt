Recent Property Thefts
The Tufts University Police Department (TUPD) wants to advise all Tufts community members that thefts of valuable electronic devices – one cell phone and four laptop computers –increased rapidly over this past weekend.
In the most recent incidents reported to police, one cell phone and one laptop were reported stolen from a fraternity on campus, while two laptops were reported taken from two sororities on campus. Another laptop was reported taken from a Tufts community member’s off-campus address on College Avenue.
The common element in these thefts is that all but one took place while the residences were occupied by several guests, some of whom may not have been invited or were not known to residents.
Tufts Police strongly advises Tufts community members to be vigilant about whom you allow into your homes and living spaces. Restrict access to known, trustworthy guests only. Secure valuables, especially highly portable devices such as cell phones and laptops, within your living spaces, especially when entertaining. Keep your doors and windows locked, even when you are at home.
Assure that you have installed and enrolled tracking software on your cell phone or laptop by contacting your service provider. In the event that your device is lost or stolen, please contact TUPD who can assist you in utilizing your tracking software.

Aggravated Assault
1
Upon investigation it appears that the victim who was threatened in the first floor bathroom of Tilton-Memorial Library this afternoon was specifically targeted by the two suspects who immediately fled campus after threatening the victim and indicating one had a weapon. The actions of the suspects appear to have stemmed from a previous domestic dispute unrelated to Tulane University or any Tulane student, faculty and staff. Tulane police and the New Orleans Police Department are actively seeking the two suspects in this case. However, we feel that there is no threat to the general Tulane community from these two suspects

PUBLIC SAFETY NOTICE
Recently there have been several area deaths linked to cocaine or heroin having been laced with the extremely potent narcotic Fentanyl. These Fentanyl drug combinations can cause rapid death if inhaled, and there is also a danger to those who simply touch or smell them.
Any drug from an unknown source could contain Fentanyl and should be avoided at all costs. The Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office and the Rochester Police Department are warning the community about the deadliness of this recent drug phenomenon.
Please contact University Public Safety if you have any questions or concerns. The only way to make sure you are safe is to have no contact with any unknown drug. Your health and well being come first, please do not put yourself at risk.

Fraud Alert
On 07/28/15, University Public Safety was contacted by a legitimate company in California attempting to verify a University Purchase Order for electronic equipment intended for the Eastman School of Music. The California company was working with two alleged University employees from Central Administration. The names used on the purchase order are University employees but, being used without their knowledge.
The California company became suspicious when the order was to be shipped to an address in Ohio, the email address did not appear to be legitimate (ESM.com) and the contact phone number returned to a national box store gift card hotline. The forged purchase order sent to the California company, although fraudulent, was quite sophisticated and authentic looking.

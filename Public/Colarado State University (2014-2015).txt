11.November 6, 2015 - CSUPD Warning Regarding Phone Scams
Several phone scams have recently been reported across Northern Colorado. Some of these scams appear to target students and employees, and we want to provide you with information that may help you recognize when a call is not legitimate.
Technology allows scam callers to "spoof" caller ID technology so that it appears that a scam call is from an official phone number, such as Colorado State University Police Department, the FBI, IRS or another location that appears to be credible.
These callers may use the university's online directory information and other findable information, such as social media accounts, to gather information about the students and employees the call to lend credibility to their scam. This can give the impression to the recipient of the call that the scam caller has access to private information, including university data. The university is on constant alert against compromises of the university's data, and is unaware of any data breaches.
The university does not list student phone numbers as part of the public online directory, but other information about students is available, such as a student's major. Employee information in the online directory includes department information and direct phone numbers.
These callers use a variety of threats to extort money from the person they reach, such as asserting that the student or employee may be facing an arrest or removal from the university for outstanding fines, bill or taxes. The caller will often reference liens, court dates, wage garnishments, jail time, and, for international students, deportation.
IF YOU RECEIVE ONE OF THESE PHONE CALLS, PLEASE REPORT IT TO CSUPD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BY CALLING 970-491-6425.
Important tips from CSUPD
	•	Virtually all attempts over the phone to solicit payment via PayPal, Western union or MoneyGram are fraudulent.
	•	Do not share sensitive, personal or financial information over the phone, even if the caller sounds legitimate and the information they are sharing is accurate. People who perpetuate phone scams go through extensive steps to make themselves look legitimate, so information from the caller or information on a website that is or appears to be affiliated with a business or agency that they claim to represent may not be truthful.
	•	Protect your passwords and online identity, including your passwords to university information.
	•	Set privacy settings on social media to prevent people you do not know from viewing your information. Do not accept requests to connect over social media with people you don't know.
	•	If you are contacted by someone claiming to be from a law enforcement agency who is demanding money, hang up and contact your local law enforcement agency to verify the information.
	•	If you are contacted by someone claiming to be from the IRS or a government office, hang up and contact that office to verify legitimacy. Report these calls to the Federal Trade Commission (http://consumer.ftc.gov/) or, if the call involves accusations regarding taxes and IRS affiliations, report the call to the US Treasury Inspector General (http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/ig/Pages/default.aspx).
	•	If you are contacted by someone claiming to be from a university office who is demanding money, hang up and call the university to verify that information.
	•	If you have been a victim of recent fraud by providing financial information to a caller, please call CSUPD at 970-491-6425. For more information about phone scams, visit http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0076-phone-scams.

CSUPD responded to a report of a man with a gun in Morgan library at about 7:40pm tonight. Suspect was rapidly taken into custody and there is no ongoing threat to campus.

13.April 29, 2015 - Warning from CSUPD About Scam
The following is an official warning from the CSU Police Department about a phone scam in the area that is targeting many CSU students and employees.
A phone scam has recently targeted students, employees and others who live in the Larimer County area. The scam callers have found a way to "spoof" caller ID so that it appears that they are calling from a phone number associated with the Colorado State University Police Department or Fort Collins Police Department. Most recently, the call appears to be associated with Larimer County Sheriffï¿½s Office, with that department receiving multiple complaints a day about the fraudulent phone calls.
Police in the area have received reports about this phone scam using the universityï¿½s online directory information, and potentially social media, to find phone numbers and personal information about the individuals they call.
The person calling claims to represent a local police department, the IRS, or another government agency and and may demand money from the individual they have called. In the past, the callers have even threatened to arrest an individual or suspend a student for various reasons.
IMPORTANT TIPS FROM CSUPD
	•	Virtually all attempts over the phone to solicit payment via PayPal, Western union or MoneyGram are fraudulent.

17.July 27, 2015 - Fort Collins police issue warning about off-campus assaults

In both cases, the victims were able to evade the assailant and police were called.
For more information about these incidents, see this press release from Fort Collins Police Services: http://www.fcgov.com/police/news.php?id=5984
The Colorado State University Public Safety Team also shares these important safety reminders:
	•	Intervene in a situation that appears to be non-consensual.
	•	In all situations, be aware of your surroundings and the people you are with, and leave a situation if it is making you uncomfortable.
	•	Take care of yourself and others.
	•	Make sure someone knows where you'll be and who you'll be with.

18.July 22, 2015 - Information about incident near campus last night
This message is from the CSU Public Safety Team and provides information about a shooting near campus yesterday evening.
Fort Collins Police Services are currently investigating a fatal shooting that occurred just north of Laurel Street and campus, in the alley between College and Mason streets, near the Alley Cat CafÃ©. The shooting occurred at 11 p.m. on Tuesday, July 21.
Fort Collins police report that they have the suspect in custody, and the university does not believe that either the suspect or the deceased are students or employees at CSU. The suspect and victim, both males, knew each other, according to Fort Collins Police Services. This means that the suspect did not choose the victim of the shooting at random, and Fort Collins police also believe that there was not a threat to public safety during or after the incident. For more information about the shooting, see this press release from Fort Collins Police Services. (http://www.fcgov.com/news/index.php?id=5981)
While Fort Collins police did not issue an emergency message to residents in the area during this incident, this is a good reminder that students who live off campus and employees can receive emergency updates during incidents that are NOT on campus by signing up for LETA (http://leta911.org/). LETA is the emergency message system used by Larimer County Sheriff Office and Fort Collins Police Services about off campus emergencies. In almost all situations, emergency messages sent through Colorado State University are only about emergencies or threats to safety that are on the physical grounds of campus. LETA is the best resource for off-campus emergencies that may present a threat to public safety.

35.Sep 19, 2014 - CSUPD warns of money phone scam targeting students, employees, using main CSUPD number
A phone scam has recently targeted students and employees. The scam callers have found a way to "spoof" caller ID so that it appears that they are calling from a phone number associated with the Colorado State University Police Department, the FBI or the IRS. CSUPD has received reports about this phone scam using the university's online directory information, and potentially social media, to find phone numbers and personal information about the students and employees they call.
Today CSUPD received more than a dozen reports from the CSU community of someone who identified themselves as a CSUPD officer or investigator from a number that appeared to be the non-emergency number for the police department (970-491-6425). The person calling claims to represent CSUPD and demands money from the student or employee they have called, threatening to arrest or suspend them for various reasons.
In other reports, the caller has said they represent someone from government agency such as the IRS. On the phone, they assert that the student or employee may be facing an arrest warrant for outstanding fines or that the individual owes back taxes, and discusses liens, court dates and wage garnishments.
IMPORTANT TIPS FROM CSUPD Virtually all attempts over the phone to solicit payment via PayPal, Western union or MoneyGram are fraudulent.
Do not share sensitive, personal or financial information over the phone, even if the caller sounds legitimate and the information they are sharing is accurate. People who perpetuate phone scams go through extensive steps to make themselves look legitimate, so information from the caller or information on a website that is or appears to be affiliated with a business or agency that they claim to represent may not be truthful.
- If you are contacted by someone claiming to be from a law enforcement agency who is demanding money, hang up and contact your local law enforcement agency to verify the information.
- If you are contacted by someone claiming to be from the IRS or a government office, hang up and contact that office to verify legitimacy. Report these calls to the Federal Trade Commission (http://consumer.ftc.gov/) or, if the call involves accusations regarding taxes and IRS affiliations, report the call to the US Treasury Inspector General (http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational- structure/ig/Pages/default.aspx).
- If you have been a victim of recent fraud by providing financial information to a caller, please call CSUPD at 970-491-6425.

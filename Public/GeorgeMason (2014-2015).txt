On October 10, 2014 at approximately 7:30 p.m., the George Mason University Police Department received information that a female student may have been sexually assaulted in the early morning hours of October 10 by a male student while in a residence hall. The student believes she may have unknowingly ingested an unidentified drug prior to the alleged assault. University Police is actively investigating this incident.

This information is being released in accordance with the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and disclose information on and near their respective campuses, including timely warnings of crimes that may represent a serious or continued threat to the safety of students or employees.

University Police reminds all community members of the following information about sexual assault:

	•	It is estimated that one in every four to five college women will be the victim of a sexual assault or attempted sexual assault.
	•	Victims are never responsible for the offender's behavior.
	•	The most common type of sexual assault is not by a stranger but by someone the victim knows, typically a date or an acquaintance.
	•	Alcohol and drugs are often used to create vulnerability to sexual assault. Studies of sexual assault incidents show a high correlation between acquaintance rape and drug/alcohol usage. Be alert to people pressuring you or others to use alcohol or other drugs.
	•	Do not drink from any open container that you did not open yourself and/or that was left unattended .
	•	Be active in supporting a safe and respectful community.  Ifyou see others engaging in disrespectful or inappropriate actions, speak up and get involved, or contact someone else to assist.
	•	Ifyou engage in sexual activity, be sure you understand your partner's limits, and communicate your own limits clearly. Don't engage in sexual activities without affirmative consent from your partner.

Note that this information is general in nature and does not necessarily relate to any specific incident. For more information on campus and community resources, please visit waves.gmu.edu . Ifyou have any information regarding this incident, please contact University Police at 703-993-2800.

In compliance with the provisions of the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act of 1988, the George Mason University Police Department is giving notice of an attempted sexual assault.

On November  13, 2014 at approximately  10:59 a.m., the George Mason University Police Department was notified by a Campus Security Authority that a female student reported that three men attempted to sexually assault her in a hallway outside of Dewberry Hall during a late-night event on November 8, 2014.  Due to the confidentiality of reporting, limited information is available regarding this incident.

Anyone with information pertaining to this crime can contact Mason Police at (703) 993-2810 or by using the Crime Solvers Anonymous Tip Hot-Line at (703) 993-4111. You can also download the free MasonWatch mobile safety application to submit information directly to the Mason Police.

Mason Police remind members of the community of the following:
	•	Alcohol and drugs may impair judgment, making it difficult to notice unsafe situations and intervene to help others. Ifeither party is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, consent cannot be given.

	•	Sexual assault is non-consensual activity, ranging from unwanted touching to forced intercourse, which can include sexual contact with someone who is impaired by alcohol, drugs, or any other intoxicant that impairs their judgment.

	•	Be on the lookout for suspicious people who may attempt to isolate someone who is intoxicated or has been drinking.  Bystander intervention is a known tool to help prevent campus sexual assault. Get involved if it's safe to do so, or go to a safe area and call for help.

	•	Engaging in any type of sexual activity without the explicit consent of your partner is sexual assault.

	•	Always seek verbal, sober, and clear consent.  Immediately stop sexual advances if the other person indicates no interest or if they say "no." Consent to one sexual act does not imply consent to another.   The absence of "no" does not mean "yes."

	•	Never pressure or coerce someone into engaging in sexual activity.

	•	Approximately 75 percent of rapes are committed by acquaintances (www.rainn.org).

	•	Ifyou are ever in a situation where you are unsure or scared, call Mason Police immediately at 703-993-2810.

	•	Ifyou witness a situation that appears unsafe or makes you uncomfortable, intervene if it's safe to do so, or go to a safe area and call for help.

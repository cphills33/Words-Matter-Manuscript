The following crime occurred in the campus area
This week, as part of a wide-ranging and in depth criminal investigation, OSU Police determined that a rape occurred in a residence hall in the early morning hours of January 25, 2014. Recent information obtained this week by OSU Police, as well as more recent actions by the suspect, including a return to the residence hall, have led police to believe there is a continuing threat, and that is why this notice is being sent. The case is still under active investigation, and it is important to identify the person described below.
Witnesses have described the suspect as a black male, between 5ft 4in-5ft 9in, with a "wide" build, between 18-20 years old. He has short, black hair, scars over most of his face, which may include a scar above an eyebrow. His complexion was described as lighter and pock-marked. He was most recently seen wearing a Cincinnati Bengals sweatshirt. On the night of the incident, he was wearing a gray coat. Anyone with information about the suspect should contact OSU Police immediately.
All university public safety resources, including security officers and police officers, are aware of the suspect description and are actively assisting. Residence hall staff are also aware of the suspect description and alert to response protocol.
As always, be cautious and look out for one another. Know the group you are going out with and stick together. Don't prop doors open or let people in who you don't know. Lock doors and windows, and if you see someone who may need assistance, always reach out for help. If you see something suspicious, call University Police or (off-campus) Columbus Police. Always dial 9-1-1 in an emergency. http://studentlife.osu.edu/articles/safety-tips

To: UC Santa Cruz Community From: Nader Oweis, UC Santa Cruz Chief of Police Re: Phone Scam Alert
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and City of Santa Cruz Police Department have been alerted to a new phone scam being perpetrated on parents of UCSC students. Parents of UCSC students have received phone calls where the caller indicates their student has active warrants and owes money for the warrants. The caller has tried to collect money for the bogus warrants.
The caller ID on the on the incoming call has been programmed to indicate an unknown number on campus (831) 459-3246 or to (831) 420-5800 for the Santa Cruz Police Department. These calls are not coming from the campus or the Santa Cruz Police Department. Neither police department accepts payment for warrant bail amounts. All warrant bails are paid through the Court Clerk’s office and not the police department. Additionally, law enforcement in general do not make phone calls soliciting money for warrant bails. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department cautions against making payments or revealing personal information over the phone or online to anyone you do not know. If anyone has received such a call, please contact our dispatch center to file a report at (831) 459-2231 x1 or with the City of Santa Cruz Police Department at (831) 471-1131. Online reports may be made with the City of Santa Cruz Police Department via their Website www.santacruzpolice.com. This option is not avialable for the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.  If you have doubts about the authenticity of a call initiated from law enforcement, you can always hang up and call us at our dispatch center to verify.  Historically in phone scams, callers have bullied the victim becoming aggressive and threatening. If you receive a call where the caller bullies or threatens, simply hang up and call the dispatch center.

Re: Assault with injury reported
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is investigating a report of an assault causing injury (Case No. 14-1068) by an unknown male subject that occurred on November 12, at 7:55 p.m. on Heller Drive near the north side Porter College bus stop. While the victim was walking towards the bus stop, an unknown make or model sedan, dark colored, driving westbound on Heller Drive, entered the bicycle lane and drove towards her.  An unknown male front passenger threw an object, striking the victim in the shoulder.  This caused the victim to stumble towards the vehicle where the victim was struck by the vehicle's bumper.  The vehicle and occupants sped from the area in an unknown direction.
In a separate incident (Case No. 14-1069) at 10:45 p.m., a female student reported that while she was walking southbound on Hagar Drive, near the bus stop at Steinhart Way, an unknown Latino male adult, 30 to 35 years old, average build with short black hair and a beard around his jawline with no mustache, approached her in his vehicle, a dark green or black four-door Honda, possibly a Civic with unknown license plate.  The male subject offered to provide the woman with a ride downtown, which she found suspicious and refused.  The driver then sped off on Hagar Drive towards the base of campus.  It is unknown if there were any passengers.   It is unknown if the two incidents are related, but because of the timing both incidents are included in this bulletin.
Anyone who may have witnessed or has information about either of these incidents is encouraged to contact the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231 ext. 1.

Re: Arrests made in recent auto burglaries; person of interest identified
On January 27, 2015 at 6:40 a.m., a UC Santa Cruz employee called UC Santa Cruz Police to report suspicious activity in the East Remote Parking Lot. Officers conducted an enforcement stop on Patrick Sizemore, a 44-year-old transient, and Jessica Bella, a 28-year-old Ben Lomond resident as they attempted to drive away.
Officers suspected Sizemore and Bella were responsible for recent auto burglaries on campus, and identified Sizemore as the person of interest in the January 13 crime bulletin. Some items from the recent auto burglaries were recovered, and it is believed that some other items located in their vehicle may have been stolen during recent burglaries in Aptos.
Sizemore was arrested on a suspicion of burglary; conspiracy to commit burglary; possession of burglary tools; possession of stolen property; unlawful possession of a prohibited knife; and possession of marijuana, and was booked into the Santa Cruz County Jail.
Bella was arrested on a suspicion of burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, and unlawful possession of hypodermic needles, and was also booked into the Santa Cruz County Jail.
The investigation into these auto burglaries continues. Anyone who may be a witness to these burglaries or has information regarding these crimes is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231, ext. 1.

Re: Community Crime Bulletin -- Battery causing great bodily injury, hate crime, mayhem, obstructing officers and drunk in public
At 12:38 a.m. on February 7, UC Santa Cruz Police arrested a male student and a male unaffiliated with campus on suspicion of battery, obstructing an officer, and drunk in public after officers responded to 911 calls of a reported fight at Kresge College. Both men were booked into Santa Cruz County Jail. There were about 30 witnesses to the incident.
After dispersing the crowd, officers found four male victims with non-life threatening injuries.
Although the investigation is ongoing, follow up investigation and interviews revealed the fight broke out because one or more of the suspects perceived that one or more of the victims belonged to a protected classification, as listed in the California Hate Crime Statues. The student suspect and the victims were living in the same college community.
Protected classifications include, but are not limited to the following characteristics of the victim:
	•	Disability 
	•	Gender 
	•	Nationality 
	•	Sexual orientation 
	•	Race or ethnicity
	•	Religion 
	•	Or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.

To: UC Santa Cruz Community From: Nader Oweis, UC Santa Cruz Chief of Police Re: Community Advisory – Fires at Pogonip
In the past year, the university has been notified about numerous illegal fires on Upper Campus and city/state park lands adjacent to campus. Members of the community, UC Santa Cruz Police Department, Santa Cruz Police Department, and Park Rangers have reported significant amounts of trash, property damage and abandoned campfires throughout these protected areas on and near our campus.
The danger is real. The threat of fire on or adjacent to our campus is serious and potentially devastating; current dry conditions have created an explosive environment.
In addition to being counter to our environmentally friendly and sustainable campus practices, these fires are very concerning because of the potential hazards they create. An illegal fire creates serious risk for loss of life or property.
So, how can you help?
Do you know people who create fire-pits, start illegal campfires or leave trash behind? Help educate them about the impact and risks by referring them to:
	•	Wildfire information: http://www.smokeybear.com
	•	Back woods litter: http://www.wilderness.net/nwps/threatsoveruse
	•	Report illegal burning and backwoods fires immediately by calling 9–1–1.
	•	If you see something out of the ordinary while in Upper Campus, Pogonip or other wilderness area, notify the authorities (9–1–1, or use the City of Santa Cruz reporting site).
	•	Request medical assistance by calling 9–1–1. This is also for anyone you see who may be coming out of the woods intoxicated.
Aside from being dangerous and putting our campus and surrounding community at risk, we also want students to know illegal fires or illegal parties can carry fines, criminal consequences and conduct action through the university.
Section 4421 of the Public Resources Code states that no person shall set fire or cause fire to be set to any forest, brush, or other flammable material which is on any land that is not his/her own, or under his/her legal control, without the permission of the owner, lessee, or agent of the owner or lessee of the land.
For more information on the various laws, policies and codes please visit:
	•	Santa Cruz Municipal Code (SCMC 19.05)
	•	California Penal Code (PC 450 - 457.1)
	•	UCSC Student Policies and Regulations Handbook (102.27a - 102.27b)
It is important that we all do our part to maintain a safe campus.

Re: Community Crime Bulletin: UPDATE -- Kresge College Investigation
Update: The second suspect, Brandon W. Beaton, turned himself in to Santa Cruz Superior Court this morning. He was processed by the jail and posted bail. A June 19 court date was scheduled. 
An arrest has been made in connection with the assault and hate crime investigation at Kresge College.
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department worked closely with the Santa Cruz County District Attorney's Office to move the case forward.
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has been investigating the events that led to UC Santa Cruz students being injured during a Feb. 7 assault in which one or more of the suspects knew or perceived that one or more of the victims belonged to a protected classification, as listed in the California Hate Crime Statues. A Community Crime Bulletin was issued as a timely warning at the time of the incident.
In collaboration with the Santa Cruz County District Attorney's Office, UC Santa Cruz police gathered evidence and secured felony warrants for the arrest of Brandon W. Beaton, 22, who at the time was a Kresge College student, and Jesse E. Robles, 24, a non-affiliate from Los Banos. Beaton no longer is enrolled at UC Santa Cruz.
This past weekend in cooperation with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, Los Banos Police Department arrested Robles on the warrant. Charges include assault with great bodily injury, resisting arrest with threats, and hate crime enhancements. Bail is set at $75,000. Robles will be transported to Santa Cruz County Jail for processing.
UC Santa Cruz officers have been working to locate Beaton. He faces the same charges with bail set at $75,000. Once arrested, he will also be taken to the Santa Cruz County Jail for processing.
Although an arrest has been made, the investigation continues. We encourage anyone who may have witnessed this incident or has additional evidence to contact UC Santa Cruz Police at 831-459-2231, ext.1.

To: UC Santa Cruz Community From: Nader Oweis, UC Santa Cruz Chief of Police Re: Phone Scam Alert
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has been notified of a phone scam being perpetrated on students. This scam is similar to one that was reported back in May, so it may be ongoing. The student receives a phone call from someone who claims to be an IRS officer or Federal Agent. The caller says that the student has unpaid taxes on student fees or loans, and tax forms that need to be filed, and they will be arrested if they don't immediately pay.
The caller tries to "verify information" and collect money for the bogus unpaid charges. If you receive a call like this, DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO THE CALLER. See if you can get contact information from the caller and then hang up. Report the incident to the UCSC Police. Contact information listed below.
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department cautions against making payments or revealing personal information over the phone or online to anyone you do not know.
If anyone has received such a call, please contact our dispatch center to file a report at (831) 459-2231 x1 or with the City of Santa Cruz Police Department at (831) 471-1131. Online reports may be made with the City of Santa Cruz Police Department via their Website www.santacruzpolice.com. This option is not avialable for the UC Santa Cruz Police Department. If you have doubts about the authenticity of a call initiated from law enforcement, you can always hang up and call us at our dispatch center to verify.
Historically in phone scams, callers have bullied the victim becoming aggressive and threatening. If you receive a call where the caller bullies or threatens, simply hang up and call the dispatch center.

Re: Community Crime Bulletin - Kidnapping, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon (knife), terrorist threats, battery, and false imprisonment (15 - 1232)
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is asking for assistance from witnesses and the community in identifying the suspects involved in the early morning kidnapping, robbery, assault, battery, and false imprisonment of UC Santa Cruz students. 
A UC Santa Cruz student reported that at around midnight on Tuesday, November 24, he was walking alone on the 400 block of Front Street in Santa Cruz, near the Greyhound Bus Station when he went by an older white, four-door sedan (unknown make or model). As he approached the car, three males and a female standing next to it started talking to him. The three males attacked the victim, took him to the ground, and began to rob him. The male suspects brandished knives and forced the student in the car. The suspects stole money and a cell phone. 
The suspects drove to Oakes College, where they forced the student to take them to a friend's dorm room, with the intent to rob more students. While in the dorm room, the male suspects again brandished knives, threatened, punched, and robbed the students, taking cell phones and money. A third roommate arrived during the robbery and was shoved into a wall by one of the suspects.
The suspects then drove off in an unknown direction.
All four student victims suffered minor injuries, including contusions to the face and complaints of pain from the attack. They were treated by the Santa Cruz Fire Department on scene.
The suspects were described as:
	•	Suspect 1 - A Latino male, 20 to 25 years of age with long, dark, slightly curly hair, who is more than 6 feet tall, weighing more than 200 pounds. He was wearing baggy jeans and a black beanie. He brandished a folding knife and threatened to use it during the incident.
	•	Suspect 2 - A white male, 20 to 25 years of age with light, medium length hair, who is about 5-feet, 11-inches tall, weighing about 180 pounds. He was wearing jeans and a green, short sleeve shirt. He brandished what appeared to be a switch blade knife during the incident.
	•	Suspect 3 - A white male, 20 to 25 years of age with shoulder length blond/brown hair. A clothing description isn't available. He was carrying an unknown object that could have been a knife.
	•	Suspect 4 - A white female, 19 to 23 years of age. No further suspect description is available.
The suspects also had a light brown pit bull with a white spot on its body.
The investigation is ongoing. Updates regarding this incident, when and if available, will be provided.

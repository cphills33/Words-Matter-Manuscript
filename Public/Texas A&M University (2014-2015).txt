Crime Alert – Arrest Warrant Phone Scam

NEWS RELEASE: Crime Alert – Arrest Warrant Phone Scam
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TO:               News Media Representatives
FROM:          Lieutenant Allan Baron
DATE:           June 2, 2015 - 1530 hours
SUBJECT:      Crime Alert - Arrest Warrant Phone Scam
The University Police Department (UPD) has received multiple reports from individuals who have received bogus phone calls from individuals claiming to be with a law enforcement agency.  All the individuals reported receiving these calls from 979-845-2345, the University Police Department's nonemergency phone number.  This is a tactic used by con artist to make it appear the victim is receiving the call from a law enforcement agency.
The victims are told they have outstanding arrest warrants and payment must be made promptly through a pre-loaded debit card or wire transfer. If the victim refuses to cooperate, the impersonators threaten arrest, deportation, dismissal of degrees, or dismissal from the university. In many cases, the callers are reported to become aggressive, hostile and insulting.
These con artists can sound convincing. They use fake names and bogus identification badge numbers. They may also know a lot about the individuals they are targeting.  These individuals usually alter the caller ID to make it look as though a government or a law enforcement agency is calling.
A government or law enforcement agencies will never:
	•	Call to demand immediate payment, nor will the agency call about debts owed without first having mailed you a notice.
	•	Demand that you pay debts without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.
	•	Require you to use a specific payment method for your debts, such as with a prepaid debit card.
	•	Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.
	•	Use email, text messages or any social media to discuss your personal or financial issues.
If you are contacted by someone requesting payment for any debt with which you are not familiar, be exceedingly cautious because it is most likely a scam.  
If you or someone you know has been a victim of a similar scam, please report it to UPD at (979) 845-2345.

Local Scams Reported to the University Police
Body
​
June 19, 2015
The University Police Dept. (UPD) has received information from a local business that multiple individuals, mostly students, have attempted to purchase pre-loaded debit cards after they received emails, phone calls, or text messages from individuals claiming to be with Texas A&M University, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or a law enforcement agency.  The victims are told they owe money for tuition, unpaid taxes, or outstanding arrest warrants and payment must be made promptly through a pre-loaded debit card or wire transfer. If the victim refuses to cooperate, they are threatened with arrest, deportation, or dismissal from the university. In many cases, the callers are reported to become aggressive, hostile and insulting.
These scam artists can sound convincing. They use fake names and bogus identification badge numbers. They may also have personal information about the individuals they are targeting.  In some cases, the victims have reported the caller knowing specific financial and identification numbers.  These individuals usually alter the caller ID to make it look as though the IRS or a law enforcement agency is calling.
The IRS or law enforcement agencies will never: -- Call to demand immediate payment, nor will the agency call about taxes or debts owed without first having mailed you a bill. -- Demand that you pay taxes or debts without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe. -- Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes or debts, such as with a prepaid debit card. -- Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone. -- Threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying. -- Use email, text messages or any social media to discuss your personal financial or tax issues.
If you are contacted by someone requesting payment for any debt with which you are not familiar, be exceedingly cautious because it is most likely a scam.  
If you or someone you know has been a victim of a similar scam, please report it to UPD at 979-845-2345.

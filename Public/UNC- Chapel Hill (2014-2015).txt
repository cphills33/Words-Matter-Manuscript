University police continue to investigate the reports that prompted the siren activation. No injuries are reported. Police ask the campus community to continue to remain in place and to be patient while their investigation continues.
03/23/14, 4:24 p.m.
Emergency: The University has activated the sirens. Police report an ARMED AND DANGEROUS PERSON ON OR NEAR CAMPUS.
	•	Go inside immediately.
	•	Close windows and doors.
	•	Stay until further notice.
	•	Follow directions from emergency responders or University officials.
The sirens are activated when there is a significant emergency or immediate health or safety threat to the campus community. When the sirens sound, stop classroom and campus activities; all UNC operations are temporarily suspended. Remain inside your classroom or a safe place in your building unless police or University personnel instruct you to take a specific action, such as to evacuate a building, stay out of a certain part of campus, or go to your residence hall and stay there.
The Alert Carolina website, alertcarolina.unc.edu, will be updated as soon as more information is available. It can take hours to resolve an emergency situation; updates may not be immediate.
You can let your family know you are okay in the event of an emergency affecting the Carolina campus while keeping cell phone lines open for emergency calls by using the American Red Cross Safe and Well list. The Safe and Well list is especially helpful in communicating with family members who are outside the emergency area. Go to www.redcross.org/safeandwell and follow the registration instructions.
If you see suspicious activity, call 911. But do not call 911 or the Department of Public Safety just to ask for information about the current incident. Police phone lines need to remain open for emergency communications.
When the threat is over, the sirens will sound again with a different tone to announce along with the voice message: "All clear. Resume normal activities." Click here for an audio sample of the siren emergency tone. Click here to hear "all clear."
When the sirens are activated - and when there is an "all clear" -- the University also sends a text message to the cell phone numbers registered by students, faculty and staff in the online campus directory. The University also communicates about an emergency using sources including:  campus-wide email and voice mail (for campus land lines), the Adverse Weather and Emergency Phone Line, 843-1234, for recorded information, and the University Access Channel (Chapel Hill Time Warner Cable Channel 4) along with other campus television channels.

About Alert Carolina
Alert Carolina, a safety and awareness initiative launched in 2008, plays an instrumental role in supporting the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s overall efforts to communicate about an emergency or a situation affecting the safety and health of the campus community.  In an emergency or dangerous situation, the University will post safety-related announcements at this website, alertcarolina.unc.edu, along with updates, information and other resources.   Remember that it may take time for authorities to investigate the situation, verify the facts and provide the campus with instructions or updates. Do not call 911 or the Department of Public Safety for general information. The Alert Carolina website will provide new details as quickly as possible.
Alert Carolina Communication
The Alert Carolina System (ACS) communicates in multiple ways with students, faculty and staff, as well as visitors, local residents, parents and the news media in the event of an emergency or dangerous situation.
Under Alert Carolina System Protocols adopted in August 2011 and revised in Fall 2013, the University informs the campus community using three different types of notifications – Emergency Warning, Timely Warning and Informational  and Adverse Weather.  An Emergency Warning is issued if there is a significant emergency or immediate threat to the health or safety of people on campus – such as an armed and dangerous person on campus, major chemical spill or a tornado warning issued for Chapel Hill and Carrboro. The emergency sirens will sound to alert people that they need to act now. Read more.
A Timely Warning is issued if there is a continuing danger affecting the campus community and notification will not compromise law enforcement efforts – such as reports of a homicide, sex offense or robbery. Read more.  An Informational  message is issued if a situation is not an emergency and does not pose an immediate threat to the campus community, but is of significant interest to the campus. These messages are intended to tell people to be aware of a particular situation. For example an alleged assault occurring on or within close proximity to the campus that does not appear to pose a continuing threat, based on currently available information, including information from local law enforcement agencies. In addition, a crime occurring off campus but due to its location may have an impact on student or employee security interests.  Notification may be elevated to timely warning notification if additional information becomes available to DPS that there is a continuing threat to the campus community. Read more.
An Adverse Weather message is issued when a tornado watch or severe thunderstorm warning is issued by the National Weather Service for Orange County. The University may also send adverse weather notifications, including email, when other circumstances exist that do not represent an immediate threat to health or safety, yet action may enable people to protect themselves and/or their property. These situations may include approaching snow or ice storms or hurricanes. Read more.
Details about the Alert Carolina System and how people can expect to receive information are included in the University’s Alert Carolina System Protocols. This document also includes information about communicating with parents and families through the Office of New Student and Parent Programs and by registering on the American Red Cross Safe and Well list.

	•	Timely Warning: Police Urge Continued Caution in Wake of Three Scooter Thefts
	•	UNC Public Safety is urging the campus community to be cautious in the wake of three larcenies of scooters on campus occurring over this past weekend.  Two of the scooters were reportedly taken from in front of the Ram Village 5Residence Hall shortly after midnight on Sunday, June 14.  The third was reportedly stolen from in front of Ram Village 3 late Saturday night, June 13 or during the day on Sunday,  June 14.  UNC Public Safety is currently investigating the thefts and is not ruling out the possibility that the incidents are related.
	•	Anyone with information which might aid detectives with their investigations should call the Criminal Investigations Division at (919) 966-2120.  Also, students and employees are encouraged to call 9-1-1 immediately if they see any suspicious activity around bike racks or scooter parking areas.  Scooter owners are required to park their scooters in parking areas designated specifically for their vehicles and to register their scooters with UNC Transportation & Parking (registration aids in the recovery of lost or stolen vehicles).
	•	Continue to monitor the Alert Carolina website (alertcarolina.unc.edu) for any updates.
	•	ABOUT THIS EMAIL:  Campus-wide email is not an instant source of information as part of the University’s timely warning notification process. Text messages sent to registered cell phone users are the fastest way for the University to notify you. That’s why email messages like this one will always include a timestamp to indicate when the message was sent. The University’s Emergency Notification System is activated using a strategy that is based on redundancy, using multiple methods to communicate. The best, most up-to-date source of information will always be the Alert Carolina website, http://alertcarolina.unc.edu.

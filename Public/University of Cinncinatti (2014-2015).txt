Cincinnati Police are investigating several burglaries that have occurred in the 3200 block of Bishop Street over the past week. The majority of these offenses occurred during daytime hours when the residents have been at work or school. Preliminary investigation indicates juveniles are most likely responsible for these offenses. 
Some burglary prevention tips include:
	•	Make sure all doors and windows are locked.  Windows you may consider inaccessible may be used by juveniles.
	•	Use good quality deadbolt locks on your doors.  If you rent, talk with your landlord about this.
	•	Leave a radio playing to make the house/apartment seem occupied.
	•	Don’t leave a key hidden outside - burglars know all the places to look.
	•	Keep hedges trimmed back so police and your neighbors can see someone attempting entry.
	•	Look out for each other - call the police if you see suspicious activity at a neighbor’s house.
Please help inform your community partners in Clifton of this current crime problem. District Five is committed to reducing crime and disorder in Clifton and has many resources and materials to help residents and property owners reduce their chances of victimization. If you would like further information or assistance, please contact Sergeant Jason Voelkerding, District Five Neighborhood Liaison Unit, at (513) 569-8506.

The behavior displayed this past weekend in the vicinity of Stratford Avenue was unacceptable and, in some cases, illegal.  The Cincinnati Police Department and the University of Cincinnati Police Department have a duty to maintain order and enforce the law. 
Disorderly conduct, failure to disperse, open containers, underage drinking, and provision of alcohol to minors will not be tolerated.  In fact, the Ohio Revised Code provides for penalties that could lead to expulsion from the university or a loss of eligibility to receive student financial assistance if a student is convicted of some of these offenses. It is also worth emphasizing that dealing with such behavior pulls law enforcement resources away from the efforts underway to address violent crime. 
As both a student and a neighbor, you can help.  If you witness a crime, call 911.  If you want to report a public safety concern, call 556-1111.  If you believe a UC student is not abiding by the Student Code of Conduct, contact the Office of Student Life at 556-5250.  
Building a better Uptown community starts with each of us.  Equally important as being smart and being safe is being respectful of the community we call home.

Campus Demonstrations Involving Firearms
The University of Cincinnati has been notified by organizations of their intention to hold two on-campus demonstrations related to the freedom to bear arms. The proposed demonstrations are legal and consistent with university policies concerning public expression and free speech.

EMPTY HOLSTERS
From 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Thursday, April 10, Bearcats for Concealed Carry, a group of University of Cincinnati students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents, and others focused on restoring the right to lawfully carry a concealed handgun on Ohio's college campuses will walk around the MainStreet area of campus with empty holsters visible. This demonstration will not include actual firearms.
CINCINNATI OPEN CARRY/FIREARM EDUCATION WALK
From noon until 3:30 p.m. Saturday, April 12, the Cincinnati Open Carry/Firearm Education Walk sponsored by OpenCarry.org, Ohioans for Concealed Carry, and Buckeye Firearms Association will take place on campus and along the perimeter of the University of Cincinnati campus. Participants will openly carry firearms as an expression of support for the right to openly carry legal firearms.
Both of these demonstrations are legal and follow city, state and federal laws concerning the open carry of legal firearms.
The University of Cincinnati strongly believes in freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.  The University of Cincinnati is fully aware that some forms of expression may be found controversial. It is because some expressions are unpopular that our nation supports these constitutional freedoms.

Shortly after noon today a department on campus received a single anonymous phone call threatening to come to campus and shoot people.  At about the same time a series of bomb threats were made via Twitter against schools across Ohio, including UC.  At this time we have no reason to believe either of these threats is credible, but we are investigating the source of both the phone call and the Twitter messages. 
If you receive any similar communication, please note the caller id information, and contact us immediately at 556-1111.  Faculty, staff, and students should, as always, remain alert to suspicious activity and call 556-1111 to report it.

University Police are investigating two theft incidents on campus that occurred on September 17, 2014.  In both incidents the suspects claimed to be book buyers. 
     The first incident occurred at Taft Law at approximately 2:00PM. A skinny male white, approximately 20-25 years old, 5’ 7”, 130lbs, wearing a multi-colored tank top entered claiming to be a book buyer. He was described as being very tan, and a bright white smile. He had a book scanner in hand, but was not a book buyer anyone was familiar with. He was directed to the area where the books were kept, and then his friend came in asking where he was. His friend was described as a male white, 20-25 years old, 5’ 9”, 175lbs, wearing a bright blue shirt with white letters on it carrying a black book bag. These subjects were seen wandering the area, and one exited an alcove where it was later discovered a book was missing worth $200. 
     The second incident occurred at Teacher’s College around 4:30PM. Two white males again claiming to be book buyers. The only description captured was on one stating he was a thin male white, 18-22 years old, wearing a tannish/ grayish colored hat, gray t-shirt, and gray jeans. The other subject was only identified as a male white. These subjects again claimed to be book buyers. When advised that there were no books to be sold, they walked away. Shortly thereafter it was noticed that 30-40 books were taken from a nearby office. Some of these books were recovered in a nearby restroom, but the total loss was close to $1000.

RE: Update on Officer-Involved Shooting 
TO: UC Students, Faculty and Staff 
FROM: President Santa J. Ono 
As you know from earlier announcements, on Sunday, July 19, there was traffic stop by a University of Cincinnati police officer that resulted in the loss of the life of Samuel Dubose.  Our hearts go out to Mr. Dubose’s mother, family and loved ones. We mourn with them relative to this heartbreaking loss of life. 
This morning, I met with Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley to discuss how we can best work together to move the city and the university communities forward following this officer-involved shooting. Here is an update on the outcomes we expect from our conversation:
•             I have indicated to the mayor that UC is open to discussing participation in the Cincinnati Collaborative Agreement. In that manner, we can enhance transparency as it relates to our relationship with the Cincinnati Police Department and our overall operations.
•             UC will be reviewing the training of our police officers and making sure that we are applying best practices in everything that we do. It is important to point out that all UC police officers receive the same state-required training as other municipal law enforcement officers.
•             Because UC is committed to a safe community, UC Police Chief Jason Goodrich and I will meet on July 27 with the City of Cincinnati Manager’s Advisory Group. Chief Goodrich and I have also decided to create a community advisory group to work directly with the UC Police Department. 
Mayor Cranley and I will be meeting with Dubose family members to offer our condolences in person. I also extended our sympathy in a statement that was released yesterday. (See http://www.uc.edu/news/nr.aspx?id=21966)
In the meantime, Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph Deters is investigating the officer-involved shooting and will release the findings at his discretion.
78.July 24, 2015 
To: UC Students, Faculty and Staff 
From: President Santa J. Ono 
Concerns have been expressed about our announcement that the UC Police Department is focusing patrols on campus, following the officer-involved shooting that occurred on July 19. We have communicated with Cincinnati Police District 4 and 5 captains, who have agreed to increase their police patrols in the neighborhoods surrounding our Uptown campuses.
We will be meeting soon with city and community leaders to evaluate our patrol areas. The changes we have announced are not intended to be permanent, and we will be monitoring them on a continuing basis to make adjustments as warranted. 
Please be assured that the safety of the university community remains our No. 1 priority. Our relationship with the city remains strong, and we will continue to work together to address any concerns. 
It is important to remember that our NightRide service will continue to operate as usual, both on and off campus (call 556-RIDE). Additionally, our Safety Ambassadors and Campus Watch patrols will continue their work in the community. 
We know that many of you want to be kept informed of the developments related to the events of July 19. A university web page has been created with all of the updates located in one place. I encourage you to use this website to find the latest information.
I hope the link below will be very helpful to you during this difficult time.

RE: Update on Shooting: Officer Tensing Dismissed
From: Santa J. Ono, President 
Once again, I want to extend our thoughts, prayers and condolences to the family and loved ones of Samuel Dubose. I was able to talk to his mother and other family members today to express our deep sorrow in person.
As a result of the Hamilton County grand jury action to indict Officer Raymond Tensing, UC Police Chief Jason Goodrich has decided to immediately dismiss Officer Tensing, and I support that decision.
Beyond the criminal investigation, the University is reviewing what has occurred and will take necessary steps to address any training, staffing and hiring policy issues that may be indicated by this tragic event. Chief Goodrich has already expressed commitment to bringing greater diversity to our police department.
As has occurred over the last several days, the University will continue to work with community partners to strengthen our commitment towards public safety best practices. We will be engaging in an external review to examine our public safety department and procedures and will address any issues that may arise.
I want to thank everyone in our UC community as well as the Cincinnati community and across the nation for their patience and understanding during the past 10 days.  I am pleased that the video from Officer Tensing's body-camera has now been made public by the Hamilton County Prosecutor. We are grateful to the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office for completing its investigation quickly.
Hopefully, we can now turn our attention to the frank and open discussions that we need to have and work our hardest to create a more just community, here on our UC campuses and across our nation.

Dear UC Community,
 
President Ono communicated with our community last week regarding a post on a social media site known as Yik Yak that potentially threatened campus safety, specifically students participating in #theIrate8 dialogue. 
UC Police investigated the matter and identified the student responsible for the post.  The Office of the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney then reviewed the case and determined that no criminal offense was committed. 
As part of the University’s procedures, this matter will be referred to the Office of University Judicial Affairs.
 
The safety of our students, faculty and staff is of the highest priority. As President Ono has made clear, the University does not condone this type of behavior and remains committed to fostering a safe, welcoming and
inclusive educational environment.

Dear UC Community, 
Please be advised that a report was filed today with Cincinnati Police regarding a possible hate crime. 
Last week, a UC student was walking in a crosswalk in the 2500 block of Clifton Avenue when the driver of a car, turning left from Calhoun St. onto Clifton Ave., shouted a derogatory comment and swerved towards the student with their car. The student was pulled to safety by others walking nearby in the crosswalk. Cincinnati Police are investigating the incident.  
Please be assured that the safety of our faculty, staff and students is of the highest priority. We will continue to work with our city partners to address safety concerns on and around campus. 
Important Safety Reminders:
•     Travel in groups at night or use NightRide (556-RIDE).
•     If you observe suspicious activity contact UCPD at 556-1111, or CPD at 765-1212 immediately.
•     If you are the victim of a crime, call 911 immediately. 
•     If someone makes you feel uncomfortable, change your walking pattern (cross the street). 
•     Criminals prefer impaired victims, don’t drink to excess.

Dear UC Community, 
The University of Cincinnati Police Department has received several reports of a check cashing scam. In each case the suspect has approached a UC student and asked the student to deposit a check into their
bank account through an on-campus ATM. Upon deposit of the check, the suspect asks the student to withdraw cash and provide it to the suspect.  In each incident, the deposited check has been fraudulent.  
The suspect, female, black, 5-feet, 1-inch tall, 145 pounds and 24-years of age,  is known to law enforcement and has been arrested multiple times by the Cincinnati Police.
If you have provided any money to this individual, please do not make any further contact with her and call UC Police at 513-556-1111 or Cincinnati Police at 513-765-1212.
Additionally, If you see something suspicious or have information about this individual, contact police immediately. You can also submit tips, anonymously, to UC Police using the LiveSafe app (free through your app store).

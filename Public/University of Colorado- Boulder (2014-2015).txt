Boulder police are investigating an Aggravated Robbery case which took place at Massage Specialists, located at 1640 Broadway, at approximately 3:43 p.m. on March 6, 2014.
An employee of the business told police that she greeted a Hispanic male who walked into the lobby, looked around for a few minutes and then made a cell phone call. When the employee began working at her desk, the suspect confronted her with a handgun and demanded that she give him cash.
The employee complied and the suspect fled the building. No one was injured.
Patrol officers, along with a canine unit from the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office, conducted a search of the area but were unable to locate the suspect.
A composite sketch of the suspect is found bellow. The case number is 14-2830.
The suspect is described as:

	•	Boulder police are investigating an officer-involved shooting that resulted in serious injuries to the suspect, minor injuries to two officers and the evacuation of an apartment building on University Hill.
	•	Based on very preliminary initial information, the incident began after police attempted to resolve what appeared to be a disagreement over a taxi fare near the corner of 12th and College streets at about 1 a.m. today. The suspect, for reasons that are not yet clear, ran from the officer on scene and into an apartment building on the southeast corner of 11th and College streets. The officer pursued him on foot and called for back-up support from other officers in the area.
	•	A very short while later, officers reported that the suspect was pointing a gun at them. Shots were then fired.
	•	Police are investigating reports that the suspect may have fired at officers. At least three officers on scene discharged their weapons.
	•	The suspect barricaded himself inside a unit in the apartment building for approximately two and a half hours before members of the SWAT team made contact with him and took him into custody. The suspect was transported by ambulance to Boulder Community Hospital, where he is being treated for gunshot wounds.
	•	Initial reports were that a second officer was injured and on the ground. He has been cleared medically and is being interviewed by investigators, as are all other officers who were involved in the pursuit and shooting.
	•	The apartment building and several surrounding residences were evacuated to ensure the public’s safety while officers attempted to resolve the situation. The Boulder County Critical Incident Team is investigating the shooting at the request of the Boulder Police Department.
	•	The Boulder Police Department appreciates the patience of residents during this emergency situation. It is anticipated that the area immediately surrounding the apartment building will remain closed to the public for several hours during the investigation.
	•	No additional media updates are expected until later this afternoon.
	•	Safety Update: Boulder Police release additional information about University Hill shooting and standoff
	•	Published: May 30, 2014
	•	Contact: Sarah Huntley, City of Boulder Media Relations, 303-441-3155
	•	Boulder police are continuing to investigate the officer-involved shooting and standoff with an armed suspect that occurred during the early morning on University Hill.
	•	The suspect, who is being treated at Boulder Community Hospital, has been identified as Coleman Stewart, with a date of birth of Nov. 30, 1990. He received two gunshot wounds during the incident. His condition is believed to be non-life threatening.
	•	Stewart lived in the residence where the shooting occurred, an apartment building on the southeast corner of 11th and College streets. He is a non-degree-seeking student taking classes through CU-Boulder Continuing Education.
	•	According to friends of the suspect, Stewart had consumed alcohol at an establishment in downtown Boulder. Concerned about his intoxication level, friends placed him in a taxi to ensure his safe arrival home. As the taxi neared its destination at about 1 a.m., it appeared to the driver that Stewart was planning to bail out of the cab without paying his fare. The taxi driver pulled up and quickly stopped outside the police annex office at 13th and College streets and started shouting for help. An officer came outside and saw the cab driver chasing a man.
	•	Unsure what had precipitated the pursuit, the officer joined on foot and radioed for back-up support from other officers, seven of whom responded. The suspect ran inside the apartment building a few short blocks away.
	•	The officers who were positioned outside the building saw the suspect point a gun at them through a window on an exterior-facing door.
	•	Three officers, concerned about the threat to themselves and others in the vicinity, fired their duty weapons. One officer was struck by a projectile in the leg and another officer was injured by flying glass to the eye. Both were treated on scene.
	•	The suspect remained barricaded inside the apartment for about two and half hours, prompting evacuations in the area. SWAT officers were able to make contact shortly after 3:30 a.m. and bring the suspect out to receive medical treatment.
	•	After obtaining a search warrant, detectives searched the apartment and found a handgun behind the front door.  The gun is a pellet gun that is a replica of a Smith and Wesson semiautomatic handgun.
	•	The three officers who discharged their firearms have been placed on administrative leave with pay, which is standard procedure for incidents of this nature.
	•	“Officers were confronted with a situation that was quickly evolving, and there was little information available about what had prompted the initial altercation with the taxi cab driver,” Interim Police Chief Greg Testa said this afternoon. “While the investigation is continuing, it appears the officers responded to a perceived deadly threat.”
	•	Charges against the suspect are still being determined. The Boulder County Critical Incident Team is continuing to investigate the officer-involved nature of the shooting and is expected to release a report in the next few weeks.

On Monday, June 2, Boulder police obtained an arrest warrant for Herbert Joseph Vallier, date of birth 05/09/1977, of unincorporated Santa Barbara County, California.  He was arrested the same afternoon without incident by the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office. The warrant alleges four charges:
	•	Assault in the First Degree - Class 3 Felony
	•	Criminal Mischief - Class 1 Misdemeanor
	•	Resisting Arrest - Class 2 Misdemeanor
	•	Obstructing a Police Officer - Class 2 Misdemeanor
Bail was set at $500,000 by the approving judge.
On Oct. 16, 2010, Boulder police officers parked two marked police vehicles in the area of 11th and College streets to investigate a call when they learned that someone had cut the tires. Several witnesses observed a man cutting the tires with a knife. Sergeant Jim Byfield attempted to contact the identified suspect, who started running north along the 1100 block of 11th Street. The suspect assaulted Sergeant Byfield during a struggle and Byfield suffered serious injuries, including a concussion, broken elbow and broken clavicle. The suspect was last seen running between houses in a northwest direction. A knife was located in the area of the assault.
Sergeant Byfield was transported to a local hospital where he was treated and released, but underwent months of rehabilitation before returning to duty. Sergeant Byfield retired in 2013 after 32 years of service to the Boulder community.
Using information obtained from concerned community members, Mr. Vallier was identified as the suspect. Corroborating information was obtained in recent weeks that led officials to seek an arrest warrant. Interim Boulder Police Chief Greg Testa stated, “Jim Byfield is happy and relieved with the arrest. This arrest wouldn’t have been possible without the public’s help.”
The case number is 10-12845. Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Kurt Foster at 303-441-4329.

News Release: Police seek public's help in identifying attempted ATM burglar (Video)

Contact: Michael Lowry, Detective Sergeant 303-492-8168 / michael.lowry@colorado.edu
The University of Colorado Boulder Police Department is seeking help from the public in identifying a male involved in an attempt to break into the ATM at the Center for Community.
On May 29 at 2:30 a.m. the suspect is recorded by an ATM video approaching in protective clothing.  He sprays an acidic solution on the ATM.  He returns later to check the acid’s progress.  He returns again in the early morning to attempt to steal cash from the machine.  He was unsuccessful in his efforts to enter the ATM.  Police were alerted to the problem with the machine a few days later when a customer suffered chemical burns when they attempted to use the machine. The student suffering from chemical burns did not seek medical treatment.
Detectives were able to locate a video of the suspect as he visited the machine on May 29th.  He is shown in a video wearing his protective clothing.  The second video shows his returning to the machine without the protective clothing.  A still photograph shows the suspect at the ATM.  The videos can be seen at www.youtube.com/cuboulderpolice.
During one visit to the ATM, the suspect can be seen hiding.  It appears the suspect heard something that startled him.
“I am concerned what the suspect would have done to anyone who surprised him during his attempt to break into the ATM,” said Detective Sgt. Michael Lowry. “The suspect caused significant damage to the ATM and we are hopeful the public will assist us in identifying him.”
The machine was damaged beyond repair.  The replacement cost is estimated at $50,000.  If arrested, the suspect would face felony charges of Criminal Mischief and Attempted Burglary. Anyone using an ATM should always be aware of their surroundings.  If you see anything suspicious, leave the area and report the incident to the local police. 
Anyone with information concerning the identity of the suspect is asked to call Detective Sergeant Michael Lowry at (303) 492-8168. Those who have information on these crimes but wish to remain anonymous may contact the Northern Colorado Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or 1-800-444-3776. Tips can also be submitted via the Crime Stoppers website at http://www.crimeshurt.com.

News Release: CU police officer Tases combative suspect

Editor’s Note: The CU Police Department does not maintain records of booking photos. For booking photo requests, please contact the Boulder County Jail at 303-441-3600.
Shortly before 10 a.m. today, Loss Prevention staff at the CU Book Store in the University Memorial Center noticed a man attempting to steal asweatshirt. The suspect, 25-year-old Jermaine L. Sillemon, was intercepted by bookstore security staff and led to an office as they awaited police arrival.
As officers arrived, Sillemon was in a hallway area and asked to sit down in the Loss Prevention office. An officer asked Sillemon to take off his backpack and drop a 6-inch pen he was holding in a threatening manner. Sillemon failed to comply and stood up. He blew out his chest, clinched his fist and started making punching motions. An officer warned Sillemon several times to sit down and comply, or face the potential of being Tased. Sillemon, still holding the pen, then lunged toward the officer. At that point, the officer deployed his Taser and struck the suspect once. Sillemon was then handcuffed and placed under arrest.
CU Police called in an ambulance, which transported Sillemon to Boulder Community Hospital. Sillemon was medically cleared and booked into Boulder County Jail on charges of felony menacing, resisting arrest, petty theft and providing false identification to a police officer. Sillemon has two Failure to Appear warrants for his arrest related to trespassing charges in the City and County of Denver. Sillemon is not a CU student, faculty or staff member.
"Just like any retail establishment, it’s not uncommon to have attempted thefts at the CU Book Store,” said CU Police Chief Melissa Zak. “The bookstore has an extensive loss prevention program. And typically thieves are cited and released by our officers. The difference intoday’s incident is that the suspect was uncooperative and combative with officers from the moment they arrived. He was asked multiple times to cooperate or face being Tased. When he lunged at our officers in a combative way, he was Tased. Our officers use the minimal amount of force needed to protect themselves and reduce the threat to the public.”

The University of Colorado Boulder Police Department is investigating an aggravated assault/possible robbery (case number 14-1817), which reportedly occurred somewhere between the 900 block of Grandview Avenue and Baker Hall on Oct. 4, 2014 between 4:45 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.
The male victim in this case reported that he believes he was assaulted while walking home from a private residence to his residence hall.  When the victim reported the incident the following day, he stated that he was missing items he had with him earlier in the night.
The victim sustained significant injuries including a concussion, and has limited recollection of the events that led to his assault. Initial information indicates that the victim may have walked eastbound on Grandview Avenue to Broadway, south on Broadway to the UMC underpass to campus, then east from the Visual Arts Plaza area (near the UMC Bike Station) to 18th Street and across to Baker Hall.
Due to the severity of the injuries sustained by the victim and a lack of information regarding the nature of the assault, investigators from the University of Colorado Boulder Police Department are asking the public to contact us immediately if they recall seeing an assault in progress or a male with facial injuries walking towards the CU campus between the hours of 4:45 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. on Oct. 4, 2014.
Anyone with information about this crime should contact CU Police at 303-492-6666. Those who have information but wish to remain anonymous may submit a tip via the Northern Colorado Crime Stoppers website at http://www.crimeshurt.com.

	•	Officers from the CU-Boulder Police Department have made an arrest in a sexual assault that occurred on campus in the early morning hours of Saturday, April 4.  The suspect, Andrew Bryant Souser, was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and attempting to influence a public official.  At this time, CUPD is not releasing Souser’s booking photograph as the investigation is ongoing. 
	•	Around 2 a.m. on April 4, CUPD officers responded to a report of a sexual assault that had occurred near the Engineering Center. The victim, a female CU student, said she was followed onto campus from University Hill. When the victim reached the Engineering Center, the suspect approached and sexually assaulted her.  During the assault, she screamed after the suspect told her he was going to rape her.
	•	A male Good Samaritan heard the scream and interrupted the attack.  The suspect fled the scene.  A short while later, CUPD was contacted and the victim provided the description of the suspect as a white male in his mid-20s who appeared to be a transient.
	•	Upon learning of the suspect’s description, CUPD began a search.  During their search, a second female approached them shortly before 3 a.m.  She told officers that a male had approached her near the University Memorial Center (UMC) and made sexually suggestive comments and attempted to touch her. She provided a similar description of the suspect in the earlier assault.
	•	Officers contacted Souser in the area of the UMC.  When contacted, Souser gave officers a false name.  Souser was arrested for the initial assault and booked at the Boulder County Jail.  Based upon the victims’ interviews, CUPD believes Souser was acting alone. 
	•	The CU-Boulder Police Department is seeking the public’s help in locating the Good Samaritan and other victims or witnesses who Souser approached. Please call Det. Sgt. Steve Cowles at 303-492-2112 with any tips. 
	•	Police announce additional charges in weekend sex assault, identify Good Samaritan who intervened to prevent further attack

	•	Editor’s Note: Deputy Chief Ken Koch and Good Samaritan Max Demby will hold a media availability at 11:30 a.m. today at the CU Police Department lobby, 1050 Regent Drive, on the CU-Boulder campus. Please contact Ryan Huff if you plan to attend.
	•	Officers from the CU-Boulder Police Department are continuing their investigation of a sexual assault that occurred on the CU-Boulder campus in the early morning hours of April 4, 2015. Andrew Bryant Souser, described as a 27-year-old Boulder transient, was initially arrested and charged with Sexual Assault and Attempting to Influence a Public Official. Subsequent investigation has resulted in the additional charges of Stalking and Harassment, for Souser’s attempted sexual contact of a second victim near the University Memorial Center less than one hour after the first assault. Souser remains in the custody of the Boulder County Jail.
	•	During the initial assault outside of the Engineering Center, a Good Samaritan responded to the victim’s screams for help, and his quick, selfless response forced the suspect to flee the scene. That individual then escorted the victim home, ensuring her safety. CUPD officers arrested Souser shortly after the assault.
	•	CUPD issued a press release that day, announcing Souser’s arrest and asking the unidentified Good Samaritan to contact police to aid in the investigation. That Good Samaritan, CU junior and accounting major Max Demby, saw media reports and contacted investigators to describe what occurred. Demby is also a Ralphie Handler who runs alongside the buffalo mascot on football game days.
	•	“Max is a hero for the quick actions he took to prevent this assault from becoming far worse,” said CU-Boulder Police Chief Melissa Zak.  “The university is repeatedly messaging to students that they need to be effective bystanders in a variety of situations. Max did that. His actions, as well as the courage of the victims in this investigation, reflect the greatest values of our students in caring for one another and having the courage to act and report to law enforcement. They are all deserving of credit and admiration.”
	•	All available evidence in this investigation continues to indicate Souser was acting alone. However, CUPD still suspects additional victims may exist. CUPD is working with the Boulder Police Department, Boulder County Sheriff’s Office and the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office in seeking the public’s help to identify other victims or witnesses who Souser may have approached over the past two months. Anyone with tips should contact Det. Sgt. Steve Cowles at 303-492-2112.
	•	Since the investigation is ongoing, CUPD is not releasing Souser’s booking photograph.

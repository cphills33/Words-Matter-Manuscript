On Tuesday, August 26, 2014, at approximately 10:36 am, officers of the University of Florida Police Department (UFPD) were conducting plain clothes theft prevention operations in the Marston Science Library. These operations were based primarily on information obtained through internal crime analysis assessment of theft incidents that have occurred over the last few weeks.

During these operations, officers located and identified James McCray, an individual who has been previously trespassed multiple times and has a long history of theft, within the building. As Detective  Jeff Moran was approaching McCray, he quickly fled and began to hide within the facility. As Detective Moran was joined by uniformed officers searching for McCray, a UF student called the UFPD and indicated that he just had his backpack stolen from a locations within the facility. UFPD officers had already established a perimeter within the facility and began a floor-by-floor search. McCray was quickly located hiding in a bathroom stall on the lower floor by Investigator Ernest Hale. McCray was ordered out of the stall by Investigator Hale and still had items stolen from the UF student in his possession. “This is a good use of crime analysis and directed enforcement efforts to effect an arrest of a        frequent offender”, stated Chief Linda Stump.
James W. McCray, 34, last known address of 3012 NE 10th St. Gainesville, Florida was arrested and charged with trespass after warning and felony theft.
The UFPD would like to remind the public that individuals like McCray, who are trespassed from the University of Florida, are placed on our web site as a matter of public record. You can find the list of those with an active trespass on-line at: http://www.police.ufl.edu/wp-content/asp/twarn/Default.aspx . If you see someone on that list on campus or simply observe individuals acting in a suspicious manner, please notify the UFPD immediately by calling either 9.1.1 or 352.392.1111 and help us work together for a safe campus.

As a result of this on-going and active sexual battery investigation, the University of Florida Criminal Investigations Division (UFCID) has identified the alleged suspect, also a student, in this case and determined that the incident did not in fact occur on the University of Florida campus and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the University of Florida Police Department. Based on the findings of the investigation to date, the alleged suspect met the victim at the Grog House on West University Avenue and, after some time, accompanied her to his off-campus residence where the incident took place. Detectives from the UFCID worked collaboratively with Detectives from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office (ASO) to interview the alleged suspect. At this time the investigation is being turned over to the ASO. Any information requests pertaining to this incident should be made to the ASO Public Information Officer Deputy Cary Gallop at (352) 494-8837.

On September 20, 2014 at approximately 1:23 a.m. an individual reported to the Athens Clarke County and University of Georgia Police Departments that he had been robbed while standing on the sidewalk at the intersection of Thomas Street and Mitchell Street. The victim reported that he encountered a group of five or six black males that asked him for a cigarette.
As he began to walk away after the encounter, the victim was struck several times in the face and robbed of his cell phone. The victim was able to provide a description of three of the perpetrators. One suspect was described as a black male about 6` tall wearing a red hoodie and dark pants. The second suspect was described as a black male about 6` tall with jaw length dreads wearing a black shirt and dark pants. The third suspect was described as a chubby black male about 6` tall and 200-220 lbs. wearing a dark shirt and light blue jeans.
This incident is similar to other robberies recently reported to the Athens Clarke County Police Department in which individuals who are sitting or walking alone in secluded or dark areas are approached by a group of individuals who ask for a cigarette or engage the individual in other conversation and ultimately assault and rob the victim.
The following personal safety strategies are recommended for anyone, regardless of when and where they may travel in the area:
	•	Always travel in groups when possible
	•	Always be aware of your surroundings
	•	Always travel in well-lit areas when possible
	•	Never display cash or other valuables in public
	•	If consuming alcohol, consume responsibly and moderately
	•	Report suspicious activity or individuals to law enforcement immediately
If you have been the victim of a crime or have information about the incidents described here or any criminal incidents that may or may not have been reported to law enforcement, you are encouraged to contact the Athens-Clarke County or University of Georgia Police Department as soon as possible.

The FBI is warning of potential scams targeting college students and employees of public universities. The scams targeting students involve “work-from-home” opportunities. Scammers ask for an account number in order to make deposits into a student’s account. The scammers add the student’s bank account to a separate victim’s direct deposit information to redirect the victim’s payroll deposit to the student’s account. The student receives a deposit from the other victim. The student is then directed to send a portion of the deposit via wire transfer to the other individuals involved in the scam.
The scams target public university employees that use direct deposit. The scammers send employees emails that appear very similar to legitimate human resources sites asking employees to “verify” their information, such as logins, passwords, etc. The scammer then takes that information, logs in to the employee’s official human resources account, and redirects the employee’s paycheck into the bank account of another individual (as described above).
The FBI warns that participation in the scam is a crime and could result in account closures and federal charges.
You can protect yourself from the scam by taking a few simple precautions: 
	•	If a job offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
	•	Never accept a job that requires the depositing of funds into your account followed by the wiring of funds to a different account.
	•	Look for poor use of the English language in emails, such as incorrect grammar, capitalization errors, and tense errors. Many of the individuals using this type of scam are not native English speakers.
	•	Never provide credentials, bank account information, login names, passwords, or other identifying information via email to someone you do not thoroughly know and trust.
	•	Forward these recruitment emails to your IT department and contact the police when you receive them.

Since January 14, 2015, the University of Georgia Police Department has investigated six thefts and/or burglaries of purses and cell phones in several north and south campus buildings. All of the stolen items were left unattended in public areas or in unsecured and unattended offices.
An individual believed to be involved in one or more of these incidents is described as a black male, approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall, with a slim build, approximately mid 50’s in age, wearing a button down shirt, dress pants and thick rimmed glasses. If you see an individual fitting this description, please call the UGA Police Department immediately.
Many of the thefts reported on campus are preventable. Some steps we encourage members of our community to take include:
	•	Don’t leave valuable items (purses, cell phones, laptops, etc.) unattended in public areas for any period of time.
	•	Keep offices locked when unoccupied.
	•	Do not attempt to confront anyone that you suspect may be involved in criminal activity. Notify the UGA Police Department immediately by calling 911 or 706-542-2200 if you observe any suspicious people, suspicious behavior, or suspicious activity.
Preventing these thefts will only occur through a partnership between the UGA Police Department and the students, staff, faculty, and visitors on campus.

On February 15, 2015 at approximately 3:35 a.m. the University of Georgia Police Department received a report of a single gunshot in the area of the Pi Kappa Alpha house on Greek Park Circle on the University of Georgia campus.
Preliminary investigation revealed that a verbal altercation between members of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity (145 Greek Park Circle) and the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity (160 Greek Park Circle) had occurred approximately thirty to forty-five minutes earlier. According to witness accounts, approximately five to six members of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity were standing between the houses while a similar number of members of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity were standing on the second floor landing on the north side of the house. An individual described as a white college aged male wearing a black or dark colored coat stepped out onto the second floor landing from within the Tau Kappa Epsilon house and pointed what appeared to be semi-automatic handgun towards members of Pi Kappa Alpha. The individual raised the gun and fired a single shot in the air and then pointed the gun back at members of Pi Kappa Alpha. At that time members of both fraternities retreated into their respective houses.
No injuries occurred during the incident. Investigators were able to determine the identity of the perpetrator and appropriate actions will be taken.
Based on the information available at this time there is no reason to believe that there should be concern for the safety of those involved in this incident or any continued threat towards the University of Georgia community.
If anyone was present during this incident or has information related to this incident who has not already spoken with the University of Georgia Police Department, please contact a University of Georgia Police Department investigator at 706-542-2200 as soon as possible.

The University of Georgia Police Department would like to remind everyone of the prevalence of scam attempts directed towards members of our community, as well as other institutions around the state and throughout the nation. These scams are perpetrated through both e-mail and phone communications. Please take a few moments to familiarize yourself with the information presented here, as your awareness is the most effective way to prevent you from becoming a victim of these types of scams.
The scammer will often represent themselves as a government or law enforcement official. Your caller ID may show the legitimate number to the agency being fraudulently identified through the use of spoofing. E-mails are also often spoofed, making the recipient believe that they are receiving a credible communication. Some examples based on real life incidents include UGA Police, ACC Police, Atlanta Police, the FBI, the IRS, Immigration and Naturalization Services, and various other local and state law enforcement agencies. The scammer will attempt to convince you that he/she has your personal information, when in reality he/she possesses only what is available through public, on-line sources.
The scammer may take several approaches. Very often the scammer informs the intended victim that they either owe money for some reason (overdue loan, delinquent taxes, jury duty, even unpaid parking tickets have been reported) or that they have some sort of active arrest warrant. The scammer, who is usually described as having a foreign accent, will attempt to scare and intimidate the intended victim into paying a fee with some sort of pre-loaded card in order to rectify the situation. Some scammers attempt to convince the intended victim that they need to transfer funds for some legitimate business purpose or provide a purchasing card number to complete some sort of UGA related purchase. In any event, always keep the following factors in mind:
	•	Legitimate law enforcement officials will NEVER contact you and ask you to pay money to satisfy an arrest warrant, fine or citation over the phone.
	•	You should NEVER provide any personal or financial information or account numbers/log-in information over the phone unless you are absolutely certain of who you are communicating with and what the circumstances are and YOU initiated the call.
	•	If you are uncertain of the legitimacy of a phone call, it always recommended that you hang up the phone and call the agency back to verify the circumstances.
	•	In reference to e-mail based scams related to UGA e-mail accounts, UGA EITS will NEVER send an e-mail requesting individuals to provide personal or account information or to click a link to “re-validate” an e-mail account on-line.
	•	Anyone who contacts a UGA official and identifies themselves as a law enforcement official seeking information related to an on-going investigation should be referred to the University of Georgia Police Department for assistance.
	•	Do not be afraid to question a caller if you aren’t certain about the validity of a call or e-mail…If something doesn’t seem right, then it probably isn’t!!
If you feel you have been victimized in some way related to a scam call or e-mail, you may report it to the University Police Department (706-542-2200 or 911 from any campus phone) or to your local police department if you are off-campus at the time the call is received.

Mr. Christensen,
I complained about this before.  You're obviously withholding pertinent information about the race of the perpetrators.  I do not believe that the victims noticed dreadlocks, a pony tail, and a gold colored car but failed to notice race.
It appears that you're deferring to political pressure to suppress obviously relevant information.  Please do not offer a lame excuse about omitting information that is not relevant to identifying a suspect.  You can get rid of a pony tail by removing a rubber band.  You should be more concerned about enhancing the safety of the community, including African Americans--who are disproportionately the victims of crime.

Dear campus community member:
We would like to update you on a recent Crime Alert regarding an armed robbery which reportedly occurred June 29 in the 0-100 block of East Stadium Drive, Champaign. At the time, we told you that a victim was approached by a man who displayed a handgun and demanded the victim’s property.
On Tuesday, July 7, the person who reported the crime was interviewed again by detectives with the University of Illinois Police Department. The individual admitted to fabricating the details of the report. No armed robbery occurred, nor was there an offender armed with a gun. This person, who has no affiliation with the University, was issued a state of Illinois notice to appear in court for filing a false police report because of the resources expended investigating the claims.
While this particular incident was fabricated, it is still important for our campus community members to be observant, to report suspicious activity and crime when it happens and to take basic safety measures which can reduce their likelihood of being targeted by a criminal. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe.
	•	Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android. 
	•	Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.

Dear campus community member:
We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes.
We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.
The Champaign Police Department has informed the University of Illinois Police Department that a student was sexually assaulted around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday at a private certified housing unit by a person known to the victim.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.
At Illinois, We Care.
Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu.
	•	If you notice a situation that seems unsafe for another person, intervene if it’s safe to do so or call for assistance. 
	•	While it is always the victim’s decision to report crime to the police, reporting is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent crime in the future. For more information about reporting rape, please visit WeCare.illinois.edu. 
	•	Be respectful of yourself and others. Make sure that any sexual act is OK with your partner, and remember that consent is an active process, not the absence of “no.” Don’t assume you know what another person wants. 
	•	Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. “I don’t want to” is always a good enough reason. 
	•	Although you can never completely protect yourself from becoming a victim of any crime, you can reduce your risk of being targeted by walking in groups, avoiding isolated or dark areas, and trusting your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. 
	•	Call police immediately if you observe suspicious activity. 
The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.
It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures.

The following aggravated battery took place at 6 p.m. on Monday, November 2, just south of the Illini Union, 1401 W. Green St. (map), in Urbana:
A U. of I. student was walking in the northwest area of the Quad when she was approached by a group of four women, one of whom pepper sprayed the student in the face. The offenders ran toward Wright Street from the Quad. The student was not seriously injured.
U of I. security cameras captured images of the four offenders, and police are seeking the community’s help in identifying the women. Those pictures can be viewed here: https://illinois.edu/blog/view/6221/273163.
The University of Illinois Police Department has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area, and we are fortunate to have our force supplemented by the Urbana and Champaign police departments. Between these agencies, the Urbana campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 1,000 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword "CCTIP" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).
This is our community. Let's stay together.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. 
	•	Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Call 217-333-1216 for a SafeWalks escort if you need one, or download the app for iOS or Android. 
	•	Be alert, and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime. 
	•	Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. For more information, please review the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan procedures. 
	•	If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.

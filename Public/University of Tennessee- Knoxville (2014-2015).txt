Consent:
The university’s interim policy on sexual misconduct and relationship violence defines “consent” as the knowing and voluntary communication, through words and/or conduct, of an agreement to engage in a particular act, including without limitation a particular act of sexual contact or sexual intercourse. More information on this policy can be found at http://sexualassault.utk.edu
Consent is never implied by a person’s attire, reputation, consumption of alcohol or drugs, previous consent to sexual acts, or your relationship to the person. Sexual assault is never the victim’s fault. The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator.
If you engage in sexual activity, be sure you understand your partner's limits, and communicate your own limits clearly. Don't engage in sexual activities without affirmative consent from your partner.
Even if you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you are still responsible for obtaining consent from the other person before initiating sexual contact.

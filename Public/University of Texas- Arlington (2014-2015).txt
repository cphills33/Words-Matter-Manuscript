Summary:
UT Arlington police are investigating complaints that students are being scammed a person who states they are with the University, a police department or another government agency. The caller tells the student that he or she owes money for a violation or a debt and directs the student to purchase a debit or gift card to make a
payment, telling the victim that if he or she fails to do so a warrant will be issued for the victim’s arrest. The caller’s phone number often is a cloned number from a legitimate agency. 
The UT Arlington Police Department urges students NOT to make an immediate payment if they receive this type of call. If you receive such a call, gather information about the caller and the agency the person says he or she is representing. After concluding the call, ﬁnd a published number for the agency and contact the agency to determine whether the request for payment is legitimate.
It is important to VERIFY the legitimacy of any call seeking payment, as many law enforcement and government agencies do make phone calls or utilize a third party collection agency to collect ﬁne revenue. Failure to make a payment on a legitimate ﬁne or debt could result in a warrant for your arrest.
Contact UT Arlington police at 817-272-3381 if you encounter or have been a victim of this type of scam, if you are unable to verify the legitimacy of such a call, or if you have information about the people committing this scam.

October 26, 2015
Dear members of the UT Arlington community,
UT Arlington students have reported the following scams.
Scam #1:  The student answered a job posting for a work from home advertisement.  The student was asked to complete a training assignment and supply a credit card number to the company. The company requested the student buy numerous computers with the credit card with the intention that the company would reimburse the student’s credit card. As soon as the funds were placed onto the credit card, the student was instructed to send the computers to a foreign country. The student sent the computers and was notified a few days later that the funds placed onto the credit card were fraudulent.  The student lost over $6,000 spent on the computers that were sent overseas.
Scam #2:  The student received an email from a company in reference to a job opening. The student received a text message from the company stating they were sending him a check and he should deposit the check into his bank account. When the student received the check, he deposited it into his account. The next day the student received another text advising him to withdraw the money and deposit it into the "company's" bank account.  The student went to his bank to withdraw the "company's" money and was told that the check was being held. The student then withdrew his own money and deposited it into the "company's" account.  He was later notified that the check was fictitious, which resulted in the loss of $1,000 of his money.
If you are approached in these or a similar fashion, DON’T FALL FOR IT.

If someone contacts you and requires you to move money or send valuables.
Ask for the caller’s name, employer and phone number.
Hang up. Attempt to verify that this call and caller are representing a legitimate agency.  If the caller claims to represent a legitimate organization, look that number up and call them directly.
Do not provide any personal information over the phone.
Do not accept money or send money/valuables.  Legitimate organizations do not make these requests.
Anyone with information about the suspects perpetrating these scams is asked to call the UT Arlington Police Department at 817-272-3381.

Statement from UTA Police Chief Kim Lemaux
11:48 a.m. Wednesday, December 16, 2015
At 10:02 this morning, we received a call about a man with a possible weapon in the Architecture Building. We then received a second, similar call. Immediately, we dispatched officers/responders.
We also issued an emergency notification asking people in the building to remain in place. Officers quickly set up a perimeter. Officers entered the building and quickly located a suspect matching the description.
He has been positively identified by the caller and is currently being detained. He is cooperative.
Multiple searches of the building have been completed.
We’re really proud of our officers and dispatchers’ response, as well as the response of our campus community.
We’ve resumed normal activities throughout the campus.

ART BUILDING, 2301 San Jacinto

Crime Prevention Tip:
A theft takes mere seconds to commit. I know we all have left our property unattended and unsecured when we knew we were just going to get a drink of water or were going to use the restroom. Thieves know this too. They also know they can pick your unattended item up and walk off even before you leave the room. We all need to keep this in mind and never leave our property unattended � not even for a second.

Loss value: $200.00. Reported on 02/12/14 at 2:10 AM.
Crime Prevention Tip: Closing your eyes for even �a bit� can make you a victim of a theft. The �sandman� is an enemy of crime prevention. Always try to stay awake in public. If you feel yourself getting sleeping, get up and stretch, gather your property and take a short walk. If you can�t stay awake, collect your belongings and use them to rest on.

COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, 2110 Speedway

Theft: A gold class ring was stolen after it was left in a 3rd floor men�s restroom. Loss value: $904.95. Occurred on 02/10/14 between 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM.
Crime Prevention Tip: Many people do not consider public restrooms a high theft crime area. Sadly, this is not the case. All too often people enter a restroom with a single purpose and thought on their minds. They are driven to accomplish their goal to the point they do not consider the security of their property. They will leave their backpack and purse on a shelf in the restroom lobby. Refrain from this, carry your property into the stall with you and hang it on the stall door hook. The other situation that leads to thefts is illustrated in this case. People often take their jewelry off when they wash their hands and leave the restroom without putting their jewelry back on. I appreciate the cleanliness � to prevent the loss or theft of your property, consider placing your rings in your pocket when you take them off to wash your hands.

COLLECTION DEPOSIT LIBRARY, 1810 Red River

Theft / Unlawful Use of a Criminal Instrument: A non-UT subject was found in the intersection of 7th Street and Neches Street while holding a black and yellow bicycle. The investigation revealed the bicycle had been stolen while secured with a cable lock to the bicycle racks located on the east side of the Collection Deposit Library. The subject was also found to be in possession of wire cutters that were believed to be the items used to cut the cable lock. Recovery value: $350.00. Occurred on 02/22/14 at 1:13 PM.
Crime Prevention Tip:
A pair of wire cutters is all it takes to defeat many cable locks. That is why the UT Police Department recommends a quality u-lock as the minimum amount of protection for bicycle security. To really protect your bicycle, use a quality u-lock and an independently locking cable lock. This would require a bicycle thief to carry two different tools and spend twice as long stealing your bike. Most bicycle thieves are too lazy for all that and will just move on to the bike that only has a cable lock. 

JESTER CENTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street

Public Intoxication: UT Police were summoned to the Jester West Lobby to check on the welfare of a non-UT subject who had difficulty maintaining his balance while walking. For that level of assistance, the subject had a resident of the dormitory. Sadly, the subject also demonstrated a classic sign of the body�s rejection of alcoholic beverages for which most friends do not stand-by�as closely anyway. The subject was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point he was a danger to himself. In lieu of being taken into custody, the subject was turned over to his friend who agreed to accept care, custody and control of him. Occurred on 02/22/14 at 2:21 AM. While on-scene, the officers observed the subject in the next caper.
Safety and Arrest Prevention Tip:
Public Intoxication is a law about safety. For someone to be publically intoxicated they must have demonstrated they are a danger to themselves and / or other people as a result of their intoxication. Because public intoxication is more about safety than it is about a law violation, police officers have options other than making an arrest. Those options include sending the intoxicated person to the hospital if they are suffering from alcohol poisoning or turning that person over to a sober, responsible adult. I cannot think of a better reason to keep a sober friend with you when you go out than to keep you from drinking and driving and to assist in keeping you out of jail. 

JESTER CENTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street

Public Intoxication: While investigating the above case, a UT Police Officer observed a UT student, who was under the age of 21, fall to the ground near the officer�s feet as the student entered the dormitory. The student produced a ticket stub when asked for identification. The student stated he was drunk but could still do calculus. The officer asked the student what 1 divided by �X� as �X� approaches infinity equaled and the student correctly answered �0� making his former calculus teachers very proud. Apparently, the student was too intoxicated to handle lesser math as he originally stated he had consumed a shot and two drinks of �mystery punch� but then counted the drink tally as 5 shots and 4 drinks of the punch. The student tried to bargain with the officer and offered a home cooked meal for his release. When the officers declined, the student demanded more calculus problems before expelling some of the alcohol from his system on a table. The obviously tired student laid his head down in the splash zone before an ambulance arrived to transport him to a local hospital for alcohol poisoning. Occurred on 02/22/14 at 2:39 AM.

JESTER CENTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street

Suspicious Activity / Scam: An unknown subject telephoned the mother of a UT student and advised her that �someone had her son.� The student was located at his class and was directed to call his parents after it was confirmed he had not been taken captive. Reported on 02/24/14 at 10:52 AM.
Crime Prevention Tip:
This type of scam as occurred in a variety of locations around the country in the past. If someone has contacted you to demand a small amount of money in return for your loved one, do the following:
�	Remain calm and try to locate your family member. Remember, the vast majority of these calls are hoaxes. Whether done as a prank or an attempt to extort money, these individuals are trying to exploit your fears. If you have caller ID, write down the number.
�	Do not tell the caller where you live or agree to any money transfer. Never provide information about you or your family (including the name of the individual allegedly kidnapped, injured, etc.).
�	Ask to speak to your family member to confirm his/her identity. This foils the majority of these calls because the virtual kidnapper only has the upper hand as long as you believe that he/she really has your loved one. Don�t be afraid to challenge them by asking �What is my child�s name?�
�	If the caller cannot or will not answer, hang up (many will hang up at the first sign of stubbornness).
�	If you or your family has been a victim of this scam, please contact your local authorities and UTPD at 512-471-4441.
�	If you are a student and your parents try to call or text you; answer the phone or respond to the text � as a parent, trust me, I know, they are concerned.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by the University Police Department patrol officers between Tuesday, 03/04/14 and Wednesday, 03/05/14.  ***ADMINISTRATIVE:  Spring Break is approaching -- here are a few safety tips for traveling:  College is a very stressful time in a person�s life. One of the ways college students relieve their stress is to go on a trip over spring break. But, sometimes these college students receive a burn before they even see the sun. This is caused by students being taken in by companies that subject the students to fraud.   Common Frauds: � Companies adding extra fees that were not originally agreed upon � Companies not providing the accommodations they may have promised � Worst case scenario: students were sold packages that did not exist and the �company� disappeared with the students money  There are some key ways to prevent fraud and allow for less stress.  Booking Your Trip: � Book your trip through a company you are familiar with or someone else has used and referred you to. � Get a contract in writing that states what you have agreed upon verbally. � Always read the fine print. � Be cautious in believing what you are told. If it seems too good to be true it probably is. � Make sure the dates you want to travel are the dates the tickets are issued for. � Don�t pay in cash; instead pay using a credit card. If you use your credit card to pay and the services you contracted for are not provided, you may not be liable for the charge on your card. � Watch out for vouchers- steer clear of companies which ask you to redeem vouchers or certificates.  Traveling and Touring: � Remember that some people prey on tourist. Be cautious of what you sign up for or who you trust when you are on spring break, especially in other countries where the laws are different. � Always keep your luggage with you and in your site. If you must step away, make sure you ask a friend you can trust to keep an eye on your belongings. � Never leave your passport, other forms of ID or money in an unsafe place. It is best to keep these with you at all times. � Never walk alone or get into a vehicle with someone you do not know.   JESTER CENTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Theft: A UT student reported her bicycle stolen from the bike racks between Jester West and Jester East.

There are significant criminal penalties for underage possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages, depending on the jurisdiction.   Personal Security  � Travel with someone you know and trust, and preferably with a larger group. Never allow members of your party to leave alone with strangers. Always travel in well-lighted areas.   � Don't carry all of your credit or bank cards in your wallet or purse. Carry the minimum amount of cash that you will need, including a little backup. Traveler's checks are your best bet when on vacation. If you have extra cash, leave it in your hotel room, hidden from sight.   � Make sure your friends and relatives know where you will be vacationing, when you will depart, and when you expect to return. Call friends or family members to let them know that you have arrived and returned safely.   Safe Partying  � Go partying with people you can rely on. Stick together, look out for each other and make sure everyone's safe. Especially watch out for friends who appear intoxicated.   � If a friend feels sick, don't leave them alone. If you feel sick, ask someone to look out for you.   � If a member of your group passes out, turn them on their side to prevent choking and call 911 immediately.   � Don't drink and drive. Before you go out, designate a non-drinking driver. Remember to buckle up!   � Watch out for your drink and never accept an open drink from someone you don't know. If you have to leave your drink for any time, ensure you leave it with someone responsible who will watch it to ensure it doesn't get spiked with one of the easily obtained "date-rape" drugs, such as GHB, Ketamine, or Rophynol.    SAN ANTONIO PARKING GARAGE, 2420 San Antonio Street  Graffiti: A UT police officer observed black painted markings on the ground floor.

In addition to other law enforcement action taken, the subject was issued a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 03/07/14 at 8:58 PM.  ETTER-HARBIN ALUMNI CENTER, 2110 San Jacinto  Possession of Marijuana: Two UT students were reported as smoking marijuana while sitting on the west side of the building. The ground, next to one of the student�s feet, was littered with a partially smoked, hand-rolled, marijuana laced cigarette. The students were subsequently found to be in possession of 3.5 grams of a green leafy substance that later tested positive for marijuana. Occurred on 03/10/14 at 3:33 AM.  FRANK ERWIN CENTER, 1701 Red River  Assault: Two patrons to the UIL Boy�s Basketball State Championship Game got into an argument over which team was better.

Occurred on 03/07/14 between 7:00 PM and 11:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: There is an old saying that goes something like �Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me.� While I do not believe it is ever the victim�s fault that a crime happened I must admit people are responsible for doing what they can to prevent a crime from happening. In this case, and in many others like this one, the theft would no doubt have been prevented by the simple act of locking a door. The vast majority of burglaries and in-home invasions happen because a door or window was left unlocked. In the simplest terms, all I can say is: �Lock your doors and windows.�  MAIN BUILDING, 110 Inner Campus Drive  Graffiti: An unknown object was used to etch markings into a mirror located inside a 3rd floor men�s restroom.

When stopped, the subject believed she was walking on a sidewalk along Lamar Boulevard. The subject was upset over a recent break-up and had obviously been trying to �drown her sorrows� to the point she was a physical endangerment to herself and the passing motorist below. The subject did not agree with the officer�s assessment to make an arrest as she made feeble attempts to resist the inevitable. Occurred on 03/09/14 at 12-midnight.   The University of Texas Police Department responded to 47 Alarm Reports, 3 �Police Help� Callbox Activations, 19 Traffic Violations, 4 Fire Alarm Activations, 15 Suspicious Activity Reports, 8 Unsecured Door Reports, 2 Found Property Reports, 18 Public Assist Reports, 3 Collisions, 1 Welfare Concern Report, 1 Chemical Spill Report, 1 Noise Complaint and 1 Medical Emergency between 03/07/14 and 03/10/14.

Discovered on 03/10/14 at 6:00 PM.  EAST MALL  Criminal Trespass Warning: Two non-UT subjects were reported as loitering and dancing on and around a statue located on the East Mall. One of the two subjects then climbed to the top of the statue to show off his moves. The music ended as both subjects were issued written criminal trespass warnings. Occurred on 03/11/13 at 6:04 AM.  JESTER CENTER ACADEMIC, 201 East 21st Street  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was reported as sleeping in a 3rd floor study lounge. The subject had previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning. The subject contested the arrest as his previous warning was given outside of a building and today he was found inside a building.

When awakened, the subject stated he had seen the other subject sleeping so he assumed it would be a good place to sleep. When it was discovered he too had previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning, he understood just how wrong his assumption had been. The area was checked for others engaged in this slumber party prior both parties being provided new accommodations for tonight. Occurred on 03/11/14 at 6:50 AM.  UNIVERSITY TEACHING CENTER, 105 West 21st Street  Theft: A white Apple iPhone 4, a silver charm bracelet and a multi-colored wallet containing a credit card and $50.00 in cash was stolen when it was left on a counter inside a 2nd floor women�s restroom.

A white female subject exited the restroom while the owner was drying her hands. Loss value: $295.00. Occurred on 03/10/14 around 3:50 PM. Crime Prevention Tip:  Sadly, this case illustrates that being in close proximity to your property just isn�t good enough�you actually need to be in contact with your property or have your eyes on your property constantly. How bad have things gotten in society when you can�t even wash your hands without the risk of property theft.

The UT Police Department does indeed recommend a u-lock as the minimum security for your bicycle. It is not enough just to have a u-lock. You need to be mindful as to how you use it. You should always loop the u-lock through your front wheel, bicycle frame and bicycle rack. If you don�t do it for your own bike; do it to protect someone else�s front wheel. For added security, use a cable lock to secure the rear wheel, front wheel and bicycle frame to the bicycle rack with cable lock as well.  PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Theft: A black backpack containing a white Apple iPad, class notes and various coins was stolen when it was left on a table in the northwest corner of the 6th floor while the owner visited the facilities.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Thursday, 03/27/14 and Friday, 03/28/14.  ***Scam Alert*** Yesterday, the UT Police Department took a suspicious activity report that re-introduces an oldie but a goodie - the �Toner Phoner� Office Supply Scam. This scam is a simple one. It starts with an unsolicited phone call to a business or office. The caller asks the person who answers the call for a multitude of information � most typically about the type of copier / printers that are used in the office. The caller will state they are conducting a survey or that they are confirming information for a placed supply order. The caller is looking to get as much information about such office equipment as he or she can get � copier make, model and even serial numbers. The caller frequently asks for information about the office manager, supply clerk or office supervisor. Once the caller obtains this information and hangs-up, he or she will make a fake invoice and send it with poor quality supplies to the company at over-inflated prices. The invoice has �make payment� information. The caller then simply waits to see which companies they contacted fall for the invoice and submit payments. This is a simple scam to avoid. Simply do not provide office equipment information over the phone to any unsolicited caller. Leave office equipment issues to the employee in your office who handles supplies.   GARRISON HALL, 128 Inner Campus Drive  Burglary of Motor Vehicle: A black Apple iPhone 3 cellular telephone was stolen out of an unsecured white Chevrolet Van while the vehicle was parked on the west side of the building while the owner made a delivery inside the building. Loss value: $100.00. Occurred on 03/27/14 between 11:00 AM and 11:15 AM.   GREGORY GYMNASIUM, 2101 Speedway  Theft: A black Apple iPhone 4 cellular telephone was stolen when it was left on a locker room bench. The owner placed the telephone on the bench and turned around to gather items out of his locker. When he turned back toward the telephone he noticed it had been stolen. Loss value: $300.00. Occurred on 03/27/14 around 9:30 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: I am sure many of you recall countless times when we have mentioned never leaving your property unattended. This is a good example of what we really mean � you need to always have your eye on your property or be in physical contact. A thief only needs a second of inattention or distraction to commit a theft. When you turn your back on your property, a thief turns his attention to it.  PARKING LOT 70, 2000 Robert Dedman  Leaving the Scene Collision: The rear bumper of a green Honda 4-door was struck while the Honda was parked and unattended. The driver of the striking car did not leave driver information. Repair cost: $1,000.00. Occurred on 03/26/14 between 7:30 AM and 8:40 PM.  UNION BUILDING, 2308 Whitis  Public Intoxication / Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was reported as being �highly intoxicated� while in the Underground Bowling Alley. The subject was located and did illustrate an inability to maintain his balance on his own. The student was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point he was a physical danger to himself. In lieu of arresting the student, he was turned over to a family member who agreed to accept care, custody and control of him. The student was issued a citation for the Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor before he was released. Occurred on 03/28/14 at 12:06 AM. About the Law: Public Intoxication is a crime center around protecting the public more than it is about punishing the offender. Someone is deemed publically intoxicated when they appear intoxicated in a public place to the point they are a danger to themselves or others. Because it is based in public safety, officers need to make sure the subject will be taken care of. To that end, a person who is publically intoxicated can be turned over to sober responsible adult, sent to the hospital if their level of intoxication requires medical attention or placed under arrest and transported to jail where deputies will assume the role of caretakers. There is no better reason to have a sober friend with you � it can keep you out of jail.  As you see in this case, anytime a minor consumes an alcohol beverage, a violation of the law has occurred � so even if you have a sober friend to care for you, if you are younger than 21, you will receive a citation.   1800 Lavaca  Assist Outside Agency / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A non-UT subject was stopped for failing to maintain a single lane of traffic and speeding while driving a blue Honda Accord. The subject was found to have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for speeding�no surprise there. The subject was also found to be in possession of a small pipe containing burned marijuana residue. Occurred on 03/28/14 at 3:03 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 14 Alarm Reports, 2 Collisions, 8 Traffic Violations, 6 Public Assist Requests, 1 Welfare Concern Report, 2 Medical Emergencies, 1 Malfunctioning Light Report, 4 Unsecured Door Reports and 6 Suspicious Activity Reports between 03/27/14 and 03/28/14.

Occurred on 03/31/14 at approximately 9:05 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: We have long encouraged people to program the UT Police Department telephone number (512-471-4441) into their cellular telephones. But what if your phone is damaged or stolen as it was in this case? That�s when the �Police Help� Call boxes come in handy. In this case, there was just such a call box within a block of the scene of the crime. The victim did not know or see this bright yellow pole with a blue light affixed to the top of it and passed by at least this one (probably others) before she contacted a police officer several blocks away. I encourage each of you to look around as you make your way around campus today and see just how many of these call boxes you can see. Make a mental note of their locations as you never know when you may need to use one.   The University of Texas Police Department responded to 23 Alarm Reports, 2 Fire Alarm Activations, 2 �Police Help� Callbox Activations, 3 Collisions, 2 Traffic Violations, 7 Public Assist Requests, 2 Unsecured Door Reports, 1 Suspicious Odor Report and 7 Suspicious Activity Reports between 03/31/14 and 04/01/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Tuesday, 04/01/14 and Wednesday, 04/02/14.  UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION BUILDING, 1616 Guadalupe  Theft: A black Mongoose bicycle was stolen when it was left unsecured in the bicycle racks located on the north side of the building. The owner of the bicycle did not lock his bicycle to the bicycle rack as he was �in a rush.� Loss value: $140.00. Occurred on 03/28/14 between 3:00 PM and 5:15 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: I know we at the police department do not give very favorable reviews of cable locks, but I must say a cable lock is better than nothing. Most thieves are opportunistic criminals; they look for easy targets. Many bike thieves expect to cut off a cable lock and they plan accordingly by carrying some form of cutting device. If you do not use any type of lock then you are benefitting even the laziest of criminals. Most of us work hard for our money, maybe we should start making bike thieves work hard for their money too. At a minimum, use a quality u-lock and use it all the time.  UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Harassment: A UT student came to the police department to report receiving several unwanted communications via text messages, Facebook posts and e-mails.

When stopped, the student refused to provide any identifying information which became a moot point when a back-up officer arrived and quickly recognized the student from a previous public intoxication case. The student�s identification was confirmed when a UT staff member approached the scene with the student�s purse which had been discarded prior to being seen by the police. The student was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point she was a danger to herself. The student�s defiant behavior during transport and booking led her to receiving her own private room for the night. Occurred on 04/02/14 at 1:49 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 32 Alarm Reports, 1 �Police Help� Callbox Activation, 2 Collisions, 3 Traffic Violations, 4 Public Assist Requests, 3 Unsecured Door Reports, 3 Medical Emergency Calls, 2 Welfare Concern Reports, 1 Accidental Damage Report and 3 Suspicious Activity Reports between 04/01/14 and 04/02/14.

A staff member followed the student out of the caf� and stopped him as he failed to pay for the items. When confronted, the student initially claimed to have only ordered one sandwich and agreed to pay for the item � when prodded by the staff member, the student produced another concealed sandwich.

It is truly a tragic loss.  Sadly, it is difficult to predict when or where an act of violence may happen. We would encourage our faculty, staff and students to invest a little time to watch the Lightning Strikes: Shots Fired safety video on the UT Police Department web page (https://www.utexas.edu/police/videos/). This short video provides the viewer with survival options to consider if found in an active shooter situation.   GREGORY GYMNASIUM, 2101 Speedway  Theft: An Apple iPod touch was stolen when it was left in the cardio room on the 1st floor of the gymnasium. Loss value: $150.00. Occurred on 04/03/14 between 6:00 PM and 7:45 PM.   JESTER CENTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Theft: An orange clutch purse containing a credit card and a driver�s license was stolen when it was left in a locker inside a basement level women�s locker room. The locker was �secured� with a combination when the clutch was stolen. The lock was still on the locker when the theft was discovered. Loss value: $50.00. Occurred on 04/03/14 between 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Combination pad locks are a measure for security but please keep in mind they are an entry level measure for security. Any security measure has shortcomings. The shortcoming of combination pad locks is that they can be easily defeated by someone who knows one of two or three ways to defeat such locks. In defeating these locks, there is typically little to no damage done to the lock. Thieves will frequently place the lock back on the locker they broke into because thieves know how poor these locks are and they don�t want them. My question for you is, �If a thief doesn�t want to own the lock you use to protect his or her stuff, then why do you want it?� To protect your property, invest in a good keyed pad lock.   ROBERT A. WELCH HALL, 105 East 24th Street  Arson: An unknown subject lit a paper towel roll on fire and placed it inside a trashcan located in a 2nd floor women�s restroom.

Here is your chance to add to your resume while winning an Apple iPad mini. The UT Wellness Network is hosting a logo competition for its new BeVocal Program.  See attached rules and flyer for the competition. Visit http://www.wellnessnetwork.utexas.edu/wg_bystander.html for more information about the program.  BLANTON MUSEUM of ART, 1900 Speedway  Theft: Sadly, a thief couldn�t buy a vowel so he stole two bronze consonants from a display sign that was affixed to a wall near the Faulkner Plaza.

Locker thefts happen with such frequency because many thieves know students use lockers to hide their property rather than secure it. Invest the few dollars and tie to secure your valuables inside a locker with a quality key operated pad lock.   PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Theft: A UT student borrowed his friend�s Specialized bike and cable lock.

A cable lock is also the level of security most bike thieves are comfortable with. Use a quality u-lock for minimum security. Use a quality u-lock and a self-locking cable lock to protect your bike or in this case, your friend�s bike.  STUDENT SERVICES BUILDING, 100 West Dean Keeton  Theft: An iPhone 4S was stolen after it was left inside a ground floor men�s restroom.

In 45% of all the auto thefts in Baker sector, keys were used to steal the vehicles.

We at the police department appreciate the customer service in asking to help people who are wandering or loitering around an office or building. Such offers for assistance send a cue to a would-be thief that the area is monitored and unauthorized people are recognized. I would encourage everyone to provide that level of attention. I would also encourage everyone to note a person�s response to an offer for assistance or to be observant if a subject leaves and then returns. If anything seems unusual about a person�s responses, their behavior or they return after leaving, call the police department. The UT Police Department provides 24 hour service every day of the year. We can be reached at 512-471-4441.

Suspects are likely loading them onto trucks and driving away. The problem area is all around UT Campus and west towards MOPAC in public areas and apartment complexes. It is recommended that owners of these types of vehicles begin locking them up to something just like they would a bicycle if they are going to leave them outside overnight. In 45% of all the auto thefts in Baker sector, keys were used to steal the vehicles. The Austin Police Department would like to remind everyone to never leave your keys in your vehicle and never leave a running vehicle unattended.  ****Design Competition**** Okay all of you creative, artistic thinkers � all of you graphic design, advertising and art majors � it�s time to put your iPad mini where your mouth is � oh you don�t have an iPad mini? Here is your chance to add to your resume while winning an Apple iPad mini.

In each one, the owner was either in close proximity to their property when it was stolen or had only left it for a few minutes. Thieves are looking for just a second or two of inattention � that is all they need to commit a theft � a second or two. Always keep your property with you and if you need to place a purse, a backpack or a camera bag on the floor next to your table, then place your foot through the shoulder strap; that will make it harder for a thief to drag your bag out from under your nose.   The University of Texas Police Department responded to 24 Alarm Reports, 1 �Police Help� Callbox Activation, 1 Fire Alarm Activation, 3 Traffic Violations, 2 Collision Reports, 9 Public Assist Requests, 2 Welfare Concern Reports, 1 Unsecured Door Report, 2 Medical Emergencies, 2 Found Property Reports and 5 Suspicious Activity Reports between 04/15/14 and 04/16/14.

My second tip deals with a good response to reports of suspicious activity. Keep your cellular telephone with you at all times. If you work, live, learn or play here on campus, keep the police department�s number (512-471-4441) programmed into your cellular telephone. Call the police department the second you observe or hear of suspicious or criminal activity � we specialize in police responses.   400 West 17th Street  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was reported as being passed out inside of a parked vehicle.

Occurred between 04/12/14 and 04/24/14.  Crime Prevention Tip: Having the serial number to the stolen bicycle was a key factor in the solving of this case and the suspect being identified. Without the serial number, the officers would have not been able to verify the bicycle as the specific one that was stolen. Make sure you have the serial numbers to your bicycle and all your other valuables like your MP3 player, cameras, cellular telephones, televisions, computers�etc, etc, etc. If you do not want to commit all of those numbers to memory, log onto the UT Police Department�s Property Registration webpage and log all of your property�s information including the serial number.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Wednesday, 04/30/14 and Thursday, 05/01/14.  ****NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR**** I need to apologize for something in yesterday�s edition � no, it�s not about the redundant nature of the phrase �a high rate of speed.� Yesterday, I missed an opportunity to stress the serious nature of dating and domestic violence as well as assaultive behavior in general. This is an epidemic problem. Consider the following: - In the United States, every 9 seconds a woman is assaulted or beaten.  - Around the world, at least one in three women have been beaten, coerced into sexual activity or otherwise abused in their lifetime. - In the United States, at least three women are murdered by their boyfriend or husband each day. - One study found that in 70% of college domestic violence cases, the violence was perpetrated by both parties. - Men can be and are victims of domestic violence. Up to 13% of reported domestic violence calls show the female as the aggressor. - Domestic Violence is the leading cause of injury to women � more so than car accidents, muggings and sexual assault victims combined. - According to the Texas Council on Family Violence, 358 Texas women were murdered in a family violence situation between 2010 and 2012. These are societal concerns. As such, we all share the responsibility of learning more about these issues. There are resources out there. I challenge everyone to learn about the signs of domestic violence, the contributing factors, the costs of these crimes, the resources available to the victims and what you can do to help others and to protect yourself from acts of violence. I have listed just a few websites to help you.  http://www.rainn.org/  http://www.helpguide.org/ http://www.aardvarc.org/ http://www.thehotline.org/ http://www.ncadv.org/ http://safeplace.org/ http://cmhc.utexas.edu/datingviolence.html https://www.utexas.edu/police/rad/   GREGORY GYMNASIUM, 2101 Speedway  Theft: A wallet containing $300 in cash, several identification cards, a credit card, a debit card and a silver James Avery ring was stolen out of the front pocket of a backpack while the backpack was left on the pool deck by lane 1 of the lap pool as the owner swam laps.

Yesterday�s note led to my e-mail inbox filling with comments from readers � I do like hearing from you. Many people sent web-site addresses pertaining to the topic of domestic violence and sexual assault so here they are. Keep learning people. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/vav.html http://knowyourix.org/  https://www.notalone.gov/  http://www.saheli-austin.org/d6/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idaUD4xTe2E   ALMETRIS DUREN HALL, 2624 Whitis  Public Intoxication: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was reported as having difficulty maintaining a vertical, upright position while walking as she entered the dormitory. It was reported that the student had been separated from her drinking friends and was �found� by another group in the west campus area who helped her get to the dormitory. The student did make it to her 5th floor dormitory room where she then had difficulty holding her liquor down. The student was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point EMS needed to transport her to a local emergency room for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. Occurred on 05/01/14 at 11:49 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: One part of this case just makes me worry � it is sad that one gets so intoxicated that they lose their friends and need assistance from strangers in getting home. If you are too intoxicated to stay with your friends or to make it home on your own, then how can you expect to make smart decisions or protect yourself? Every year I see this situation with young students who simply want to go out and have fun. Sadly, their quest for a night to remember frequently turns into a night they would like to forget. Settling this concern is much harder than just telling students to �Know when to say when� or �think before you drink.� Aside from knowing the laws pertaining to underage drinking and driving while intoxicated, students need to know how alcohol affects them. Alcohol is a depressant that dulls the senses slows just about every function of your body. They need to know that alcohol continues to absorb into their systems even after they stop drinking. That means if you continue to drink to the point you think you want to be at you will inevitably absorb much more than you wanted. Knowing this, slow your drinking process and alternate between alcoholic beverages and water (alcohol also dehydrates you). This way you can better control the degree of intoxication you experience as well as the degree of negative consequences form over-consumption.    JESTER CENTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Criminal Mischief: An 11th floor �Exit� sign was knocked down from its mounting bracket.

Occurred on 05/09/14 at 9:42 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: Many prescription medications have a warning on the side of the bottle that clearly advised to not operate heavy equipment. A motor vehicle qualifies as heavy equipment. Before you take prescribed medications, make sure you understand the possible side-effects. Your pharmacist can go over any and all potential side effects with you � always ask for the consultation and ask questions. Even after having such a consultation, you should refrain from engaging in such activities as driving a vehicle until you fully understand how the medications affect you�oh and also, don�t drive unless you have a driver�s license.    LITTLEFIELD DORMITORY, 2503 Whitis  Theft: An Apple iPad 2 in a brown and red case was stolen when it was left in a desk located in the dormitory lobby.

The discovering student contacted 9-1-1. Both students were found to have consumed alcoholic beverages. Because the discovering student contacted emergency services for the other student and remained on scene until assistance arrived, neither student will face criminal charges or administrative sanctions for the offense.

Removal cost: $50.00. Reported on 05/08/14 at 12:00 PM (noon).   SAN JACINTO RESIDENCE HALL, 309 East 24th Street  Theft: A UT student reported he found the front wheel to his bicycle secured with his u-lock to the bicycle racks located on the west side of the dormitory. The student �secured� the rest of his bicycle with a cable lock. The rear wheel, frame, seat, handlebars, pedals, brakes�well, everything that wasn�t secured with the u-lock was stolen. Loss value: $650.00. Occurred between 05/09/14 and 05/12/14. Crime Prevention Tip: UTPD does recommend the use of two types of locks at the same time to protect your bicycle. It is important to note that you need to use the u-lock and the cable lock properly to maximize the protective nature of the locks. The u-lock should be used as your primary lock and should secure the front wheel and frame to the bicycle rack. The cable lock should be used to secure the rear wheel and frame to the bicycle rack. To see an illustrative video on how to use the two lock system, visit: http://www.utexas.edu/police/prevention/double-lock-your-bike.html Have you noticed I typically place the word �secured� in quotation marks? Have you ever wondered why I do this? Well � simply put, I do this because a cable lock, by itself, offers little to no protection so the bicycle really isn�t �secured� in my opinion. Most bike thieves steal bikes that are secured with cable locks because they are easier to defeat than a u-lock is. There are a few bike thieves who specialize in defeating u-locks. Each type of lock requires different tools to defeat and additional time to defeat them. That is why a cable lock is the lowest form of protection, a u-lock is our minimum recommendation and the use of both locks is our best recommendation. Even then, it is important to use both locks properly.    The University of Texas Police Department responded to 28 Alarm Reports, 3 Fire Alarm Reports, 2 �Police Help� Call Box Activations, 7 Public Assist Requests, 1 Collision Report, 1 Found Property Report, 4 Traffic Violations, 2 Unsecured Door Reports, 2 Water Leak Reports and 5 Suspicious Activity Report between 05/12/14 and 05/13/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Wednesday, 05/21/14 and Thursday, 05/22/14.   AT&T EXECUTIVE EDUCATION & CONFERENCE CENTER, 1900 University  Theft: A UT Staff member reported the theft of his wallet while he was at work. The staff member stated he placed his wallet in his back right pocket before work and noticed his wallet was missing at the end of the day.

The black synthetic wallet with a Batman logo contained various forms of identification, bank information and a debit card. Loss value: $5.00. Occurred on 05/21/14 at 5:49 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: It has not been determined that this was a pick-pocket case, but I would like to address pick-pocket prevention anyway. People who pick pocket look for crowded areas, particularly in confined spaces. Often times they will use a distraction technique to clean out your pocket(s). These techniques include, but are not limited to, bumping into you or engaging in a conversation (often times to ask for directions). It is common for people to carry their wallets in their back pockets or coat breast pocket. Thieves know this so that is where they target. Knowing all of this, consider doing the following: - Place your wallet, cellphone etc. in your front pocket. I do this anytime I am in a crowded area. - With your wallet in your front pocket, it makes it easy to naturally keep your hand over your wallet by placing your hands in your pockets. - Wrap a rubber band around your wallet. The friction of the rubber helps to keep your wallet in your pocket. - Check for your wallet often. I do this anytime I am bumped into.  - Limit the amount of items you carry in your wallet. Only carry the bank cards, cash and identification cards you need to carry.   1900 Guadalupe  Driving While Intoxicated: A driver of a vehicle flagged down an officer to report the driver of another vehicle who was swerving.

Occurred on 05/22/14 at 7:52 am.   SAN ANTONIO PARKING GARAGE, 2420 San Antonio Street  Burglary of Vehicle / Criminal Trespass: A UT Staff member reported seeing a non-UT subject walking around parked cars and attempting to open the doors. At one point the staff member saw the subject inside a parked car looking through the contents of the car�s glove compartment box. The subject was located and found to have previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning. The owner of the vehicle the subject entered was contacted and reported a few dollars in change had been stolen from the vehicle. Reported on 05/22/14 at 12:34 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Like most theft cases, this offense was a crime of opportunity. The burglar was not looking for a specific vehicle to break into or a specific item to steal. The suspect simply played the odds looking for an unsecured vehicle. Once he found one, he simply spent a little time looking for whatever he could steal�in this case, a few dollars in change. To help protect your vehicle, always keep your doors locked and your windows rolled up. Never leave anything inside your vehicle. It costs a thief nothing to enter an unsecured vehicle or even break into a secured one. Anything that person steals is all profit to him or her.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 20 Alarm Reports, 3 �Police Help� Callbox Activations, 5 Traffic Violations, 5 Suspicious Activity Reports, 2 Medical emergency Reports and 9 Public Assist Reports between 05/22/14 and 05/23/14.

Occurred between 05/22/14 at 5:30 PM and 05/23/14 at 6:30 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: A safe is only as good as the security around it and the protocols for accessing it. Any safe can be defeated by a motivated thief with the right skill set and tools. The thief�s job is made even easier if the he or she has access to the safe. Keys and access cards should always be with the person they are issued to and never loaned out or left unsecured.  900 West Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was reported as being passed out in the roadway.

The Longhorn Lights Out Program is an initiative to get faculty, staff and students to turn their office lights off, power down their computers and turn the monitors off as they leave for the weekend on the last Friday of every month. The April Longhorn Lights Out initiative resulted in a reduction of approximately 2,364 kilowatts of energy usage � that is enough energy to run an average Texas home for a month�that�s pretty good � makes me think I might power down before my quitting time (just kidding Chief; I�ll be here all day).

The officer located a non-UT subject in possession of the bicycle a few blocks away. The subject exclaimed he had purchased the bicycle earlier in the evening and that he did not possess any lock cutting tools. All of this information was offered up before the subject was told the bicycle was stolen � hmmm. After the subject was taken into custody, he admitted he had considered running upon seeing the officers, but decided not to as he felt he was �too fat� to run. Recovery value: $630.00.

The two lost, but good Samaritans were given directions to their dormitory. The third subject was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point she was a danger to herself.

Persons attempting to gain unauthorized access to a system do so through user accounts, and your password may be the only safeguard against such access.  NEVER GIVE YOUR PASSWORD TO ANYONE ELSE, even people you trust, such as your friends or relatives or someone who has offered to help you fix a problem. If you suspect someone may have discovered or guessed your password, change it immediately.  JESTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor: A responsible UT New Student Orientation participant called the police department with concerns about his orientation roommate who had returned to the dorm room in a state of intoxication.

In order for amnesty to apply, the person calling for help must remain on scene and provide assistance to any medical or law enforcement personnel who arrive to help.

One of those locks needs to be a u-lock. Using a u-lock and a cable lock forces a thief to carry and use a cutting device and a prying device.

Leaving your property unattended for any amount of time makes it susceptible to theft. Keep your property with you. You should also keep the contact numbers to your credit and debit cards with you � program those numbers into your cell phone. The second you discover your bank cards are missing, contact the credit and debit companies to cancel your cards. Like in so many other cases, the thief commits the theft and goes shopping immediately � that doesn�t take long either.   2300 Speedway  Driving While Intoxicated / Possession of Marijuana / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A UT Student was stopped for driving her blue Honda Accord through a mall with restricted vehicular access.

For the most part, they happened within a few hours and during the daytime. Many think their property is not a susceptible to theft during the daytime. I don�t know of many who prefer to work nights � thieves are not much different. They will work day time hours if we let them. Keep your property with you or locked up at all times; day and night. Also, if you see someone wandering around your building or looking in places they shouldn�t be, we recommend you provide good customer service by asking if you can help them. Often times, that is all it takes to get a thief to move to another building.   PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 201 East 21st Street  Theft: A grey Diamondback Podium One bicycle was stolen while it was �secured� with a cable lock to the bicycle racks located on the north side of the library.

Loss value: $100.00. Occurred on 06/20/14 between 8:30 AM and 11:00 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: I often use quotation marks around the word �secured� in a bicycle theft case. This is because I do not see cable locks as actually securing bicycle in Austin. Texas. Many of the bicycle thieves in Austin, Texas can cut through a cable lock in just seconds. If you want to secure your bicycle we recommend at a minimum the use of a quality u-lock.   1800 Guadalupe  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was observed staggering and using a street light pole more for balance than illumination prior to crossing Guadalupe Street in defiance of on-coming vehicles.

In each call, the caller advised she owed the IRS back taxes and would need to pay or an arrest warrant would be issued. This sharp employee recognized this to be a possible scam and refused to provide any information to the caller. The employee then did just what we encourage people to do when they receive a suspicious telephone call, she checked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) web site and learned this was a common scam in which the callers attempt to extort money. Reported on 06/24/14 at 9:43 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: While the actions of the staff member in the above narrative provide us with plenty of tips, I would like to offer one more. The University of Texas at Austin ITS Telecom Services offers a great service regarding suspicious and harassing telephone calls. This service allows UT to capture the telephone number of a caller who dials into a UT telephone. To capture the number of suspicious caller, simply disconnect the call by hanging the phone up. After hanging up, pick the receiver back up and dial *57. You will hear a message indicating the number of the last in-coming call was captured. Disconnect the call and tell the responding officer that you captured the number using the �*57� feature on your campus phone.   PETER T. FLAWN ACADEMIC CENTER, 2304 Whitis  Criminal Mischief: An unknown subject forcefully removed one of two locks to the drawers of a copy machine located in the northwest corner of the 1st floor.

Occurred on 06/23/14 between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: While this was not a bicycle theft, it does highlight the value of using more than one lock to secure your property.   ROBERT A. WELCH HALL, 105 East 24th Street  Theft: A white Apple iPad 2 was stolen when it was left inside an unsecured drawer in a 2nd floor office desk.

The Longhorn Lights Out Program is an initiative to get faculty, staff and students to turn their office lights off, power down their computers and turn the monitors off as they leave for the weekend on the last Friday of every month. The April Longhorn Lights Out initiative resulted in a reduction of approximately 2,364 kilowatts of energy usage � that is enough energy to run an average Texas home for a month�that�s pretty good � makes me think I might power down before my quitting time (just kidding Chief; I�ll be here all day). For more information about this program, visit: http://www.utexas.edu/facilities/sustainability/LightsOut.html     GUADALUPE PARKING GARAGE, 1616 Guadalupe Street  Leaving the Scene Collision: A UT staff member reported witnessing a collision near the entrance to the parking garage.

Loss value: $1,207.00. Discovered on 06/26/14 at 11:46 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: There is no high tech tip here�just good old fashion crime prevention. Most burglaries and thefts happen because a door or window was left unlocked. In this case, the door that was unlocked is typically kept locked. In such situations these doors are rarely checked � it is just assumed they are locked. Whether it is your office or your home, you should do regular checks of your doors and windows to make sure they are closed and locked.   200 East 21st Street  Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: Two non-UT subjects were reported as sitting in a parked Mazda sport utility vehicle while smoking marijuana. The subjects were located in an abundant halo of a pungent odor. The odor was readily recognizable as that of recently burned marijuana.

Shortly, thereafter, a victim reported the subject had grabbed her hand so hard it caused her lingering pain. The subject was located by a nearby business where he had been asked to leave after he threw �objects� at an employee. The subject was then taken into custody. Occurred on 06/26/14 at 8:50 AM.  Crime Prevention Tip:  This subject�s behavior was concerning for many reasons. Many of the reporting people in this case indicated they noticed the subject was acting oddly before he made physical contact with them. If someone�s behavior makes you feel uncomfortable, leave the area and do so quickly.   100 East Martin Luther King  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was found lying on the sidewalk. A taxi cab driver was then seen trying to place the female in the back of his cab.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Monday, 06/30/14 and Tuesday, 07/01/14.  BELO CENTER OF NEW MEDIA, 300 West Dean Keeton  Theft: A Dell XPS laptop computer was stolen while it was �secured� with a cable lock to a desk located inside a 3rd floor office. The cable lock was affixed to the computer through a rear port on the computer. The cable was still attached to the desk and did not appear to be damaged. Loss value: $970.00. Occurred between 06/27/14 at 3:00 PM and 06/30/14 at 8:45 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: If you have been a reader of the Campus Watch for any length of time, you have probably read that the UT Police Department does not recommend using a cable lock as your sole source of security for your bicycle. If you wouldn�t trust your bicycle security to a cable lock then you certainly should not trust the security of your laptop computer to a cable lock. The laptop computer cable lock has several security weaknesses. First, one of the cable ends is frequently looped around a table leg. A thief could simply lift the table up, unloop the cable and steal the lock and computer. Another concern is the thickness of the cable. Most laptop cable locks are very thin and can easily be cut by wire cutters. Another concern is that the end of the cable that attaches to the computer plugs into a computer port by a small lip which can simply be pulled from the laptop (believed to be what happened in this case). Finally, a laptop cable lock provides the owner with a false sense of security which causes them to take risks with their laptop security. Keep your laptop with you. Refrain form leaving it in your office overnight. If you must keep it in the office, lock it up in a lockable desk or cabinet.  PETER T. FLAWN ACADEMIC CENTER, 2304 Whitis  Graffiti: Yellow spray paint was used to write words and draw images on several walls located inside the men�s restrooms located on the 2nd, 3rd and fourth floors.

This annual celebration of freedom is often accompanied by firework displays that light up the night�s sky. Sadly, many of these displays are set off by residents in their own neighborhoods. This can lead to great tragedy. Every year, people are injured and worse killed by the improper handling of fireworks. This concern has grown to the extend most communities have banned fireworks within the city limits. The City of Austin is one such community. The possession of fireworks within the city limits is prohibited and fineable up to $568.00. If an injury or property damage is caused by illegal fireworks, those fines turn into felony grade crimes which carry with them confinement in jail. We all want to celebrate the birth of this great nation, but let�s do so safely.  The Austin Symphony Orchestra and H.E.B. present the 38th Annual Austin Symphony 4th of July Concert and Fireworks at the Circuit of Americas. This is a FREE show that not only includes a fireworks display synchronized to music, but also has several family activities.

If you receive any suspicious e-mails, do not reply to the e-mail, do not provide your information or click on any links the sender adds to the e-mail. If you get an e-mail like this, look the telephone number up for your HR Representative and call that person directly. You can file a police report and / or make a complaint at www.ic3.gov   LABORATORY THEATER BUILDING, 303 East 24TH Street  Criminal Mischief: A glass door was shattered.

Reported on 07/18/14, at 2:18 AM.  UNION BUILDING, 2308 Whitis  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was reported as panhandling by asking pedestrians for money.

The subject�s saliva did not travel far enough to make contact with the student so she continued into the store. Upon leaving the store, the student was confronted by the same subject again. This time, the subject wielded a knife and began to yell �noises.� The student quickly left the area and called the police. The subject was stopped a few blocks away and was taken into custody. Occurred on 07/17/14, at 12:15 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: I would like to point out a few things in this case. First, upon being spat at, the student entered the store to remove herself from the aggressions of an offensive person. Upon having that person present a knife, the student did an excellent job of recognizing the danger and acting quickly to flee the area. The student called the police in a timely manner and provided a good description of the subject. The quick reporting and good description is what led to UT�s Finest apprehending this person.   The University of Texas Police Department responded to 21 Alarm Reports, 5 Callbox Activations, 2 Fire Alarm Activations, 5 Traffic Violations, 6 Public Assist Requests, 1 Medical Emergency Report, 3 Suspicious Activity Reports, and 1 Suspicious Person Report between 07/17/14 and 07/18/14.

JONES HALL, 721 East Dean Keeton  Theft / Credit Card Abuse: Two credit cards were stolen from a wallet that was left in a bag behind a desk in a 6th floor office. The victim left the office unsecured several times throughout the day. The discovery of the theft occurred when a suspicious charge alert was sent to the victim by one of her credit card companies. Upon checking the histories of both cards, a total of 10 unauthorized charges were made on the two cards since the time of the theft. Other staff members in the building reported seeing a subject loitering and wandering around the building earlier in the day. That subject told some staff members he was looking for a restroom.

Occurred on 07/28/14 between 9:00 Am and 3:26 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: We often see thefts from offices in which a subject simply walks around a building looking for an unsecured or open office door. The thief would then walk into the office, rummage around for a few seconds to see what he or she could take. If the subject is confronted by a staff member, he or she will give a simple excuse for being there � like looking for a restroom or someone�s office and then leave the area. If you see someone loitering or wandering around your work place then offer them good customer service with a simple question � �May I help you?� When the person replies to your inquiry; continue your good customer service by offering to escort them to their intended destination. At that point, most thieves will give an excuse to leave the area. If that happens, let them go and call the police department to provide as detailed of a description as you can about the subject and where you last saw him or her.  To protect your office, never leave your office unsecured. Close and lock your office door anytime you step out of the office � even if it is just for a few seconds.   PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Theft: A black camera bag containing a Nikon D5000 DSLR camera was stolen when the bag was left inside an unsecured 5th floor group study room.

Occurred on 07/28/14 between 6:00 PM and 6:40 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Aside from never leaving your property unattended, there is another crime prevention tip I want to mention here. Just about every piece of electronic equipment has a serial number. Locating lost or stolen property without a serial number is next to impossible. Make sure you know the serial numbers to your property. To help you with this, the UT Police Department offers a free, on-line, property registration program.

Occurred on 07/30/14 at 7:57 AM.  GREGORY GYMNASIUM, 2101 Speedway  Theft: Two pair of shoes, a gym bag, a work out shirt, a blue iPod shuffle and miscellaneous toiletries were stolen from a locker located inside the 2nd floor men�s locker room while the locker was �secured� with a combination pad lock.

A motivated thief with the right tools (an empty soda can and tin snips) can open a �secured� combination pad lock in seconds leaving the lock undamaged. A brutish thief with a hammer can open a combination pad lock with minimal damage to the pad lock in even less time. To protect your valuables, invest in and use a keyed pad lock.  MOLECULAR BIOLOGY BUILDING, 2500 Speedway  Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject was reported as sleeping in the bicycle racks located on the east side of the building.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Thursday, 07/31/14 and Friday, 08/01/14.  ***WORDS OF ADVICE FROM OUR AUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT PARTNERS*** The Austin Police Department West District Representative asked us to pass along some useful information regarding the pending rush of students moving into off campus housing around the 40 Acres. Please take time to read their words of wisdom below:  During the move in time in August, the Austin Police Dept. is often over-run with calls regarding parking violations in the West Campus area. We would like to remind you to be cognizant of all �No parking/tow away zones.� Also we ask that you not block streets, fire hydrants, alleys, drive ways, etc. We will have extra patrol out monitoring and enforcing the above listed violations as well as looking for other violations. Also, we ask that you be aware of your surroundings and who may be watching you. Be sure to keep your vehicles locked when unattended, shut and lock your residence door, and do not prop open exterior doors on apartment complexes. Code enforcement will also be out monitoring/enforcing potential code violations. Vehicle Safety o Most vehicle burglaries are crimes of opportunity. o Most of the items stolen are left within plain view. o Many victims do not lock their doors or roll up their windows. o Most commonly stolen items include wallets, purses, briefcases, backpacks, cell phones and accessories, portable electronics, and cd�s. o If you wallet/purse are stolen you could become a victim of fraud. o If you walk up on your vehicle while a crime is in progress this incident has the potential to become violent. o Your vehicle can be burglarized in less time than it takes to read this. Personal Safety o Be aware of your surroundings and walk in well-lit areas. o Do not walk alone at night. Avoid areas that are less populated. o Be alert and observant so you can give a good description to police. o Watch your drink and your friends drink. Date rape drugs do happen. o A majority of sexual assaults are committed by somebody you know. In the vast majority of these cases, alcohol is the most commonly used �weapon�. Always have a plan and stay in pairs. What if I�m afraid to call the Police? � Callers can remain anonymous. � You may request the responding officer not contact you. � If you don�t call who will.   DEVELOPMENT OFFICE BUILDING, 2901 North IH 35  Criminal Mischief: The door lock cylinders on the front doors of a Chevrolet 1500 van were forced into the door panel. Entry was not made into the vehicle. Repair cost: $300.00. Occurred between 07/30/14 at 4:50 PM and 07/31/14 at 8:00 AM.  GEORGE I. SANCHEZ BUILDING, 1912 Speedway  Theft / Credit Card Abuse: A 6� brown leather Banana Republic wallet containing various identification cards, a debit card and a credit card were stolen was stolen from a purse that was left in an unsecured 3rd floor office. The theft occurred when the owner propped the back door to the office open with a stapler as she went across the hall to a restroom to wash her hands. When the staff member returned, she noticed the stapler had been moved and the back door to her office was closed and locked. After a 45 minute meeting, the victim discovered the wallet had been stolen. Prior to her annulling the debit card and credit card, four unauthorized charges were made on the credit card. Loss value: $60.00. The theft occurred on 07/31/14 between 1:00 PM and 1:05 PM. The credit card abuse occurred on 07/31/14 between 1:05 PM and 2:15 PM. Crime Prevention Tips: This type of theft happens frequently. There are several thieves who roam around campus just looking for an opportunity. A propped open door is just such an opportunity. A thief only needs a minute or two in an office to locate a purse, backpack, cell phone � well, anything. Never leave your office unattended and unsecured. Close and lock your office door � even if you are just stepping out for a minute. Another recommendation is to lock your purse, backpack, wallet etc. in a cabinet or desk drawer when you first arrive at work. Leave such items locked up until you need them.  Once a thief has your credit or debit card, he or she starts spending and they continue to do so until the cards are cancelled. Always keep the contact information to such cards with you � list them as a contact in your cell phone (just the customer service number � not the account number). Write that contact number down and keep a copy at your home and in your office. Immediately cancel your debit and credit cards as soon as you discover them missing.   The University of Texas Police Department responded to 15 Alarm Reports, 1 Fire Alarm Activation, 9 Traffic Violations, 2 Collisions, 2 Unsecured Door Reports, 1 Stuck Elevator, 6 Public Assist Requests and 2 Suspicious Activity Reports between 07/31/14 and 08/01/14.

One thing that helps a thief commit such a crime is the lack of attention given to drying clothes. Don�t get me wrong, I am not suggesting each of you sit there and watch your clothes go round and round. Maybe consider combining your laundry time and study time. If you don�t feel comfortable sitting in a laundry room as your clothes get clean and dry, consider sitting in the hallway while you study, read a book, communicate by text or Facebook or Instagram for that matter, invite a friend to go with you � safety in numbers. In any event, stay in the area of your clothes and promptly remove them when they are done � doing that will cut down on wrinkles too.  MONCRIEF-NEUHAUS ATHLETIC CENTER, 2015 San Jacinto  Criminal Trespass: A UT staff member reported seeing a subject who was known to the staff member as having previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning in the building.

For anyone who uses a locker, please hear me when I say a locker is only as good as the lock used to secure it. An unsecured locker does no good at all.   MUSIC RECITAL HALL, 2405 Trinity  Theft: A silver colored iPod touch, an Optimus LG L9 cellular telephone and a wallet containing three identification cards, 2 credit / debit cards, a bank card containing the owner�s account number, an uncashed check and three gift cards were stolen after they were left in an unsecured basement level storage room.

Loss value: $100.00. Occurred on 09/17/14 between 12:30 PM and 12:45 PM.  GUADALUPE PARKING GARAGE, 417 West 17th Street  Burglary of Motor Vehicle: On 08/30/14 a non-UT subject entered a 2006 Jeep Wrangler and stole a car radio converter, a backpack containing a wallet, a tow rope, a vehicle jack, several gift cards and a flute from the vehicle. It is believed the thief entered the vehicle through the zip-up soft top. The owner did not report the burglary to the UT Police Department at that time. The thief was later arrested by the Austin Police Department for burglary of a habitation. When arrested, the thief was found to be in possession of the stolen wallet. Loss value: $440.00. Recovery value: $10.00. Occurred on 08/30/14 between 11:30 AM and 7:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip:  We never recommend you leave any property in your vehicle. This is even more imperative if you have a vehicle that cannot be locked or one that has a soft-top convertible like a Jeep Wrangler. If a thief can see property in your vehicle he or she will use force to break in. If they can enter just by unzipping a soft-top cover, it just makes their job easier.   MEZES HALL, 154 West 21st Street  Disrupting a Meeting or Procession / Assault by Contact / Criminal Trespass / Criminal Trespass Warning: Where do I start? The UT Police Department responded to a call of two subjects dressed in costumes that would tend to cause some of us older folks to ruminate to our childhood Saturday morning cartoons. The �cat and mouse� were reported as dancing around the South Mall prior to entering Mezes Hall classrooms where they disrupted classes that were in session. The two were accompanied by two other non-UT subjects who were capturing their tales on video. The four were later located inside the PCL Library engaging in the same Tom and Jerry foolery. The investigation revealed one of the four subjects had previously received a written criminal trespass warning. That subject was also reported to have run his hand down the back of a female student inside a Mezes classroom. The two �cartoons� were found to have disrupted a meeting or procession when they stopped educational classes in session. They were subsequently taken to the pound or what many of us would call jail. The other two were issued written criminal trespass warnings and directed to leave the campus. Reported on 09/17/14 at 5:11 PM.  2200 Guadalupe  Assist Outside Agency: A non-UT subject was observed walking around his vehicle while it was parked and running in the middle of the roadway.

Occurred on 09/17/14 at 10:02 PM. Moral of the story: If you have 10 outstanding arrest warrants, don�t block a busy roadway with your car while you stretch your legs.   2500 University  Graffiti: Red spray paint was used to write words on an electrical box located on the side of the road. Removal cost: $50.00.

Neither of the students appeared to be intoxicated to the point they were publically intoxicated and were issued citations. Occurred on 09/19/14 at 4:39 AM.  STUDENT SERVICES BUILDING, 100 West Dean Keeton  Harassment / Terroristic Threat: A UT student report a non-UT subject and former roommate of the student had been placing several unwanted and threatening telephone calls to the student�s telephone after the student asked the non-UT subject to move out of their apartment.

Occurred between 09/18/14 at 2:00 PM and 09/19/14 at 10:45 AM.  Crime Prevention Tip: The UT Police Department recommends you pick the same page number in every textbook you own � say page 119. On that same page number in every textbook you own, write your state issued driver�s license number i.e. TX 01234567. That way, if your textbooks are stolen you can advise the officer taking the report that your driver�s license number is written on page so and so. With that information, your textbook could be identified in the hands of the thief or at a book buy-back store. Without such an identifier, it would be almost impossible to tell your textbook form another textbook of the same title and author.   JESTER CENTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Public Intoxication: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was reported as being unresponsive while exhibiting a severe involuntary physical reaction to the over-consumption of an alcoholic beverage.

The color description of the juice matched that of what the student expelled from his body. The student was found to have consumed so much of the juice from the jungle that Austin-Travis County EMS needed to transport the student to a local hospital for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. Under the Medical Amnesty policy, charges were not filed against the student.

An inventory of his still wet clothes revealed three shirts had been stolen form the dryer. Loss value: $30.00. Occurred on 09/18/14 between 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM. If I did my math right, the theft occurred at 9:13 PM.   LYNDON B JOHNSON LIBRARY, 2305 Robert Dedman  Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject was reported as sleeping on the stairs located on the south side of the building.

The subject was not able to stand without the assistance of the sign pole and demonstrated an ever greater difficulty sitting down as she almost fell over when attempting to do so. When asked how much she had to drink, the subject replied, �All over.� I think that sums this call up nicely.

Occurred on 09/22/14 at 4:02 PM.  Crime Prevention Tip: Some of the items in the subject�s possession were electronics with serial numbers.

Loss value: $2,100.00. Occurred on 09/23/14 between 4:35 PM and 4:45 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: This theft happened in a 10 minute window. Often times we believe our property will be safe if we will be away from it for only a few minutes. Have you ever thought just how long it takes for a thief to commit a theft? In this case, the thief saw an open office, walked in, picked up a bag and walked out. That is just a few seconds. A ten minute window of opportunity is an eternity of time when the crime only takes three or four seconds. Never leave your apartment, office, dorm room or home unsecured.   WEST PICKLE RESEARCH, 4000 West Braker  Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject was found sleeping in a tent located in the wooded area on the west side of the property.

There have been 6 residential burglaries between 8/24/14 and 9/23/14 in this area alone. They are occurring mainly between 10 am and 3 pm.

The caller directed the student to withdrawal $500 from an ATM and place the cash on a Green Dot Debit Card. The caller remained on the phone with the student as she and a friend walked to a near-by pharmacy where the student planned to make the withdrawal from an ATM. Before the student withdrew the money, a little sleuth work revealed this was a common scam. After the student disconnected the call, the caller called the student back four times.

The caller�s persistent, authoritative and threatening comments nearly had the student following through with the withdrawal and payment via a debit card. If you receive such a call, ask for a call back number from the caller and disconnect the call. Contact the police department to verify the veracity of the caller and to report the scam.    2100 San Jacinto  Driving While Intoxicated: A non-UT subject was stopped for disregarding a stop sign and driving at a rate higher than the posted speed limit while driving a black Toyota truck.

The reporting person advised while he was approaching one of the busier entry gates, a male subject in-front of him kept blocking his path as they slowly walked. At one point, the reporting person felt a tug on the back of his pants. The reporting person checked his back pocket where he kept his wallet and found the pocket flap had been unbuttoned. The reporting person�s wallet was not stolen and he did not see anyone who he believed unbuttoned the pocket but believed someone tried to pick his pocket. Reported on 10/06/14 at 2:08 PM. Crime Prevention Tips: Pick pocket thieves love massive events with huge crowds. In such an environment, it is easy to pick a pocket undetected as people expect to be bumped into and frequently do not check their pockets or purses after such incidental encounters. Pick pockets rely on this to line their pockets with your property. Here are a few tips to help keep your pockets full. First, just as this person did, use the security features available to you; especially in crowds. Button the pocket flap and keep your purse zipped or buttoned up. Some other considerations include, carrying your wallet in your front pocket when entering crowded spaces. Here�s an oldie but a goody, wrap a runner band around your wallet. This will provide the extra friction needed to alert you to a possible thief picking your pocket. Be mindful of people engaging in mundane conversation like asking for directions. While you are pointing out map locations, they are lifting your wallet or cell phone under the map. Also realize many who make a living picking pockets use distraction techniques to cause you to focus on something other than your wallet. Such distraction techniques could include bumping into you, having another block your path to cause you to slow down or change directions, having a partner create a scene by falling, fighting with another or fanning a medical emergency or by simply asking for directions. If you find yourself being distracted, simply place your hand on your pocket containing your wallet or clutch your purse under your arm.   NORTH OFFICE ANNEX BUILDING, 101 East 27th Street  Theft: A grey Lenovo laptop computer was stolen after it was left on a table inside a 1st floor classroom.

If not, it�s about time you start.

Check out the attached flyer for more information.   CHEMICAL PETROLEUM ENGINEERING BUILDING, 200 East Dean Keeton Attempted Theft / Public Intoxication / Possession of a Fictitious Driver�s License et al: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was reported as pulling on bicycles and bicycle wheels on the west side of the building. After pulling on wheel from a bicycle, the student saw the reporting person and threw the tire down before taking flight south on Speedway. Investigating officers found construction workers who reported the same subject had run through their construction site. In the construction site, officers found a construction truck with an open door. The interior of the truck appeared disturbed. The student was soon located in the 2300 block of San Jacinto while in possession of items that were believed to have been stolen from the truck � not to mention a fictitious identification card that purported the student to be older. The student had difficulty maintaining his balance and was literally covered in mud from head to toe.

While searching the now arrested subject, two plastic baggies containing a white powdery substance was found in his jacket pocket. The subject�s response to this discovery � �Well, this is embarrassing.� The .84 grams of cocaine wasn�t just embarrassing � it was illegal. Occurred on 10/18/14 at 2:40 AM.   COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS, 305 East 23rd Street Criminal Trespass Warning: Three non-UT subjects were reported as checking bicycle locks to bicycles that were secured to the bicycle racks located on the west side of the building. The reporting person over-heard one of the subjects directing the other two subjects to try various numbers on the combination locks. The three subjects split up prior to the arrival of the police officers. One of the three subjects was located and stopped. That subject provided less than sensible reasons for his and the other two subject�s behaviors. That subject was issued a written criminal trespass warning. The other two subjects were described as a white male with short brown hair wearing a white shirt, khaki cargo shorts and having a black backpack while the other subject was a white female in her 30�s with red dyed hair (brown roots) and a �raspy voice.� Occurred on 10/19/14 at 5:49 PM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman Public Intoxication: While investigating the below report, a UT student, who was under the age of 21, was observed �slouched over� while seated in section 39 during the football game.

Occurred on 10/18/14 at 8:15 PM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman Public Intoxication: A UT student was reported as being �near passed out� while seated in section 39 during the football game.

Occurred on 10/18/14 at 9:12 PM.   DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was observed stumbling down a flight of stairs and was later deemed to be in intoxicated to the point he was a danger to himself.

When the student returned to her backpack and jacket, she discovered her cellular telephone that she had placed in the folds of her jacket had been stolen. The student used the phone�s tracking software with audible alert feature to track her phone to an unidentified individual who initially denied having the phone but gave the phone up once the audible alert sounded again. After returning the cellular phone, the suspect left the area. The suspect was described as an older Hispanic male, with a medium build and wearing a blue long sleeve shirt, black pants and having an orange backpack. Recovered value: $500.00. Occurred on 10/18/14 between 8:30 AM and 9:00 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: There are a few things I would like to highlight with this report. First, your property is not �secure� if you are in the area. To keep your property secured, you either need to have it with you or locked up. Secondly, the tracking software on electronic items like phones and laptops are excellent tools in helping to recover lost or stolen property. Most of these types of tracking programs need to be turned on or set-up prior to the item being stolen. Check your electronics. If they have locating programs or applications of this nature get them set-up before you wished you had. And finally, if you find yourself in this type of situation, please refrain from confronting the suspect yourself. You never know how someone will respond to being called a thief. If possible, keep the person in sight and contact the police department.   PARKING LOT 80, 1900 Red River Criminal Mischief: An unknown subject or subjects cut rectangular shaped holes in the back of three portable restrooms located in lot 80 and two other portable restrooms in lot 118.

The walk will help your circulation and increase your oxygen intake which will help to keep you awake. If that doesn�t work and you still feel the need to take a little nap, please attach your backpack to you by looping your foot through the shoulder strap or consider using your backpack and its contents as a pillow.   The University of Texas Police Department responded to 27 Alarm Reports, 3 �Police Help� Callbox Activations, 1 non-Criminal Fire, 9 Suspicious Activity Reports, 10 Traffic Violations, 4 Medical Emergency Reports, 2 Unsecured Door Reports, 1 Accidental Damage Report and 4 Public Assist Reports between 10/20/14 and 10/21/14.

The student recognizing this as odd contacted the police department. The vehicle was located and the driver, a UT student, was identified. The student claimed he procured the lights from his church over the summer as he used them to help with traffic control.

The subject was found seated on a bench and covered in the regurgitated contents of his stomach. The investigation revealed a friend, in an attempt to �sober him up� removed his clothing and placed him in the shower.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Monday, 10/27/14 and Tuesday, 10/28/14.  CREEKSIDE RESIDENCE HALL, 2500 San Jacinto  Theft: A UT student locked his bicycle to the bicycle racks located on the west side of the dormitory by securing the rear wheel of the bicycle to the bicycle racks with a lock. When the student returned, he discovered the bicycle turned into a unicycle as the rear wheel and lock were still attached to the bicycle rack but the rest of the bicycle had been stolen. The bicycle was described as a black Globe road bike. Loss value: $200.00. Occurred on 10/24/14 between 12 midnight and 3:00 PM.  Crime Prevention Tip: The minimum recommendation for securing your bicycle to a bicycle rack is to use a quality u-lock to secure the front wheel and frame to the bicycle rack. To further secure your bicycle use a cable lock to secure the rear wheel and frame to the bicycle rack in addition to the u-lock.    NURSING SCHOOL, 1710 Red River  Graffiti: Pink spray paint was used to write two words and draw an image on the exterior stairwell wall located on the southwest side of the building. Removal cost: $150.00. Discovered on 10/27/14 at 7:43 AM.   SAN JACINTO RESIDENCE HALL, 309 East 21st Street  Burglary of a Habitation: A UT student reported a pair of prescription glasses, a set of black headphones and a bottle of prescription medication was stolen from his dormitory room of the weekend of 10/10/14 and 10/13/14.

Occurred between 10/10/14 and 10/13/14.  Crime Prevention Tip: See below tip   SUTTON HALL, 305 Inner Campus Drive  Theft: A MacBook Pro was stolen when it was left inside a 2nd floor office. The owner believed he had closed and locked his door but admitted the latch to the lock may not have engaged properly as he had been having problems with the lock. Loss value: $1,500.00. Occurred on 10/27/14 between 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Door locks are a key (no pun intended) element to security. If you believe your door lock is not working properly take action to see that it gets repaired. Of course, a lock is only effective if it is used. Never leave your office or dorm room unsecured. As always, when you close and lock your door, you should test to make sure it is secured properly. This can be done by simply trying to open it without unlocking the lock.    TRINITY PARKING GARAGE, 1815 Trinity  Theft: A red Trek hybrid bicycle was stolen while it was secured with a �thick� cable lock to the bicycle racks located on the west side of the garage. The thickness of the cable proved to be of little deterrent to a bike thief with a cutting device. Loss value: $175.00. Occurred between 10/24/14 at 5:00 PM and 10/27/14 at 7:30 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: You should not base the security of your bicycle on the thickness of the cable you use to protect it. Most bike thieves can cut through just about any size of cable lock in a matter of minutes. The Police Department�s minimum recommendation for bicycle security is a quality u-lock that takes a flat key.    UNION BUILDING, 2308 Whitis   Theft: A black and brown Jansport backpack containing a MacBook Pro laptop computer, an apartment key and a black Calvin Klein wallet with $1.00 and various forms of identification was stolen when the backpack was left in the 3rd floor lounge area as the owner took a quick break in a near-by restroom.

Loss value: $100.00. Occurred on 10/28/14 between 9:15 AM and 9:50 AM.   JESTER ACADEMIC CENTER, 201 East 21st Street  Criminal Trespass: UT Police Officers responded to a welfare concern report of a non-UT subject who was �laughing hysterically� in a 1st floor student lounge. The laughing ceased when officers learned the subject had previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning stemming from prior aggressive behavior. The subject was taken into custody. Occurred on 10/28/14 at 11:05 PM.   SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK, 1925 San Jacinto  Theft (2 counts): Two employees reported having their wallets stolen from their purses. Both employees use the same cabinet located in a 1st floor cabinet to store their purses during the workday. One employee�s purse contained three credit cards, $60.00 in cash, a gift card and two forms of identification while the other employee�s purse contained a debit card, a gift card, one form of identification and $5.00 in cash. Total loss: $125.00. Occurred on 10/27/14 between 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: I am a big fan of keeping your personal belongings in a cabinet or desk drawer during the work day but only if that cabinet or drawer is secured. In this case, the room was in a tightly controlled access area so the victims felt comfortable leaving their property in an unsecured cabinet. Sadly, thieves can and do access controlled areas. Make sure you lock your valuables in a secured cabinet or drawer if you cannot keep them with you.   UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION BUILDING, 1616 Guadalupe  Criminal Trespass Warning / Assist Outside Agency: A non-UT subject was located sleeping in a nook behind a retaining wall located on the east side of the building.

The officer stopped the subject and learned he had three outstanding outside agency arrest warrants for two drug paraphernalia charges and one pedestrian in the roadway charge. The subject is no longer being combative - toward pedestrians anyway. Occurred on 10/28/14 at 7:57 AM.  2530 Guadalupe  Credit Card Abuse: A UT student reported that unbeknownst to her the UT identification card issued to her containing Bevo Bucks had been stolen.

Occurred on 10/28/14 at approximately 5:50 PM.  1900 San Jacinto  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was reported as being �passed out next to a bottle of alcohol.� No doubt the bottle was empty upon discovery of the subject. The subject was found �splayed out with his legs in the roadway.� The subject was found to be under the influence of an intoxicating beverage to the point Austin-Travis County EMS needed to transport the subject to a local hospital for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. Occurred on 10/28/14 at 9:49 PM.  2300 San Jacinto  Criminal Mischief: A silver pen was used to write words on the table top of a solar charging station located near the road. Removal cost: $20.00.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Wednesday, 10/29/14 and Thursday, 10/30/14.   Halloween Safety & Crime Prevention Tips  I am confident many of you know the old Halloween safety and crime prevention tips � wear reflective costumes, carry a flashlight, only use facsimile weapons that look fake, don�t eat your treats until you get home and inspect the delectable foil covered morsel, trick-or-treat in neighborhoods where you know the residents (this is great for community building as well), use face make-up instead of masks as make-up is more comfortable and does not interfere with your vision, have a set trick-or-treating time for the kids so they know when to be home � for that matter, get out of the house and go with them - make sure your tricks do not violate any laws etc, etc, etc.   All of these are great tips, but keep some other things in mind as you gear you and your family up for a night of freight. As a property owner, make sure your lawn, driveway and sidewalk are clear of debris and lawn overgrowth. Keep your porch light on as long as you are dispensing the trick repellant treats. Before your masked guests arrive, take a few minutes to move items like your bicycle into your garage, house or backyard � this stops advertising to the more devious tricksters who may want to return later for the purpose of stuffing your property into their bag of treats. For more great tips, tricks and prevention treats, spend a little time doing an on-line search for Halloween safety tips and Halloween crime prevention tips.  The college aged ghosts and goblins may seek out a different type of spirit � just that spirits. Holidays are always a dangerous time for alcohol consumption. Halloween is perhaps one of the most dangerous days for college students as it is a day when students want to leave the drudgery of their college life behind to seek out the anonymity found behind a mask. Halloween is a day when students want to be someone else and try new things - to have fun. Such atmospheres lend themselves to overindulgence and as I have experienced the last 20 years, overindulgence with alcohol frequently does not end well. With this in mind, students � I implore you to know your limits, make a plan today to keep from overdoing it tomorrow night. Know and keep your limits � one easy way to do this is to only bring the amount of money for the amount of drinks you know you can handle. Bring a sober friend with you � they are out there and I assure you they too will have fun being sober tonight. Don�t drive to your location. If you don�t drive to your trick-or-treating haunt then you can�t drive back home. Take a cab or the e-bus. Take a second to read the last line of the first paragraph - make sure your tricks do not violate any laws; and above all � Be safe!    INTRAMURAL FIELDS, 4901 Guadalupe  Criminal Trespass Warning / Assist Outside Agency: A non-UT subject was reported as sleeping on the soccer fields. The responding officer found the subject curled up in a sleeping bag fast asleep. When awakened, the subject stated he was just �taking a nap.� The subject was found to have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for Theft of Service. In addition to other law enforcement action taken, the subject was also issued a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 10/29/14 at 11:24 AM.  JESTER EAST, 201 East 21st Street  Theft: A grey Scattane road bike was stolen while it was secured with a u-lock to a bicycle rack located on the west side of the dormitory. Loss value: $300.00. Occurred between 10/27/14 at 12 noon and 10/28/14 at 11:00 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: While a quality u-lock is our minimum recommendation for bicycle security, every now and then a thief comes along who is proficient at defeating u-locks. That is yet another reason to consider our maximum recommendation. Use two different types of locks. A quality u-lock and a cable lock. This forces a thief to carry two tools and spend twice as much time defeating locks to commit the theft. Most thieves aren�t that dedicated and will move on to a bike that has just one lock.   600 East Martin Luther King  Public Intoxication: A patrolling UT officer observed a non-UT subject seated on the curb next to an empty half-gallon bottle of Vodka. Curious to know what happened to the contents of the bottle, the officer stopped and spoke with the subject. The location of the missing vodka became clear when the subject stood up claiming he could walk and promptly stumbled into the roadway. The subject was found to be under the influence of an intoxicating substance to the point he was deemed to be a danger to himself. Occurred on 10/29/14 at 10:50 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 19 Alarm Reports, 1 Fire Alarm Activation, 1 �Police Help� Callbox Activation, 7 Suspicious Activity Reports, 5 Traffic Violations, 3 Unsecured Door Reports, 1 Welfare Concern Report, 1 Medical Emergency Report, 1 Found Property and 10 Public Assist Report between 10/29/14 and 10/30/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Wednesday, 10/29/14 and Thursday, 10/30/14.     ****SCAM ALERT**** In the past few days, the UT Police Department has learned of several instances where UT students received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a member of the Internal Revenue Service or one of many local police departments. The caller advises the student there is an open criminal investigation against them pertaining to Tax Laws violations or in one instance, �tuition related criminal charges� and then threatens arrest warrants if the student does not make an immediate payment. After gaining confidence by providing information about the student, which can be derived from the directory, or by pointing out the caller�s telephone number which matches prefixes of the Austin Police Department (cloned number), the caller directs the student to get money, convert it to Green Dot Pre-paid debit cards. The caller would then ask the student for the account information off of the debit card. This is becoming a common scam that targets college students.  If you receive such a call, demand a warrant number or cause number from the supposed �arrest warrant.� You should also ask for a report number. You should then disconnect the phone call and contact the police department.    *****Halloween Safety Tips***** FACULTY, STAFF AND PARENTS:  - Know the route your kids will be taking. - Make sure that a trusted adult is going with your children. If you can't take them, see if another parent or a teen-aged sibling can go along. - Know what other activities your children may be attending, such as parties, , church festivals or school functions. - Set a time that your children should be home. Make sure they know how important it is for them to be home on time. - Plan costumes that are bright and / or reflective. Make sure the costume fits well to prevent tripping or visual impairments � don�t forget about the shoes (clown shoes have been known to cause falls) - Consider adding reflective tape or striping to costumes and trick-or-treat bags.  - Secure emergency identification (name, and contact phone number) DISCREETLY within Halloween attire or on a bracelet.  - Use non-toxic and hypoallergenic makeup or a decorative hat as a safe alternative to a mask � this will allow greater visibility.  - Wear flame resistant costumes.  - Think twice before using simulated knives, guns or swords. If such props must be used, be certain they do not appear authentic and are soft and flexible to prevent injury.  - Obtain flashlights with fresh batteries or glow sticks for all children and their escorts.  - Plan ahead to use only battery powered lanterns or glow sticks in place of candles in decorations and costumes.  - Teach children their home phone number and to how call 9-1-1 (or their local emergency number) if they have an emergency or become lost. Remind them that 9-1-1 can be dialed free from any phone.  - Review with your children the principle of "Stop-Drop-Roll", should their clothes catch on fire.  - Openly discuss appropriate and inappropriate behavior at Halloween time.  - Consider purchasing individually packaged healthy food alternatives (or safe non-food treats) for those who visit your home.  - Take extra effort to eliminate tripping hazards on your porch and walkway. Check around your property for flower pots, low tree limbs, support wires or garden hoses that may prove hazardous to young children rushing from house to house. - Learn or review CPR skills to aid someone who is choking or having a heart attack. - Parents should check outdoor lights and replace burned-out bulbs.  - Restrain pets so they do not inadvertently jump on or bite a trick-or-treater.  STUDENTS - Plan your night in advance; know where you are going, how you will get there, how you plan to get back, how much money your night will cost and only take that amount of money. - Know your limits and stick to them. - Know that a one ounce shot has the same alcohol content as a 12 ounce beer.  - Avoid risky behaviors or situations like drinking games / challenges � don�t �double dog dare� anyone and don�t fall into such a trap from another person.  - If you throw a party, use safe drivers / sober friends for your party quests. - Take a sober friend with you to help keep you out of too much mischief. Central Booking (jail) will no doubt have the most interesting costume party in Austin tonight, but trust me, you don�t want to participate in that costume contest. Have fun tonight but be smart � after all, you are UT Students. TRINITY PARKING GARAGE, 1815 Trinity  Criminal Mischief: An impetuous UT student has been irate towards Parking and Transportation Services employees since his parking citation appeal did not meet his expectations. The student had sent several profane e-mails to said employees prior to being the only subject in the area when a door to the PTS office was forced shut with such vigor that the door�s closure device was damaged. The student left the area between the time the door was damaged and the police department was notified. Repair cost: $250.00. Occurred on 10/30/14 at 9:00 AM.   SAN JACINTO PARKING GARAGE, 2401 San Jacinto  Leaving the Scene Collision: The owner of a white Mazda 4-door reported he returned to his parked car and found a $20.00 bill and a note on the windshield of his car. The note directed the owner to the back left bumper where the owner found two dark rub marks on his bumper. The note did not contain any driver information of the striking vehicle and the $20.00 will not cover the repair cost of $50.00. Occurred between 10/29/14 at 1:00 PM and 10/30/14 at 6:20 PM.    27TH STREET PARKING GARAGE, 109 West 27th Street  Leaving the Scene Collision: The back right quarter panel of a blue Toyota Camry 4-door was struck by an unknown vehicle while the Toyota was parked on the 2nd level of the garage.

Upon stopping, the subject exited his vehicle and refused to follow the directions of the officer. The subject pulled from the officer�s grasp and made several attempts to physically prevent the officer from affecting an arrest. When the physical resistance stopped, the subject turned to a verbal plea in asking the officer to not arrest him as it would be his �3rd DWI� arrest.

A resident inside the dormitory observed this subject�s behavior and opened the door for the subject and allowed him entrance. The subject then went to the front desk and asked if the dormitory had a laundry room before inquiring about employment. After the staff member directed the subject to other dormitories regarding employment, the subject claimed to be raising money for his church and asked for a donation. After the staff member declined, the subject again asked for a laundry room before walking away. The staff member attempted to keep an eye on the subject but lost sight of him. Responding officers located a resident of the dormitory who indicated a subject matching the description entered her unlocked dormitory room and closed the door behind him. The subject told the resident he was raising money for a charity. After the resident gave him some change, he asked for a laundry room. The resident led the subject to a first floor laundry room. Once the subject looked into the laundry room he exited the dormitory through a stairwell exit door. The subject was described as a Black male approximately 40 years old, missing several front teeth and was last seen wearing a black t-shirt with the words �Hip Hop Legend� on the front of the shirt and had an identification badge stating �Emergency Response Team� on the front of the badge. Reported on 11/03/14 at 3:15 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: I apologize for the length of this entry, but this caper illustrates so many crime prevention issues. First and foremost, the card reader doors on campus are intended to keep unauthorized people out of restricted areas. If you do not know someone has authorization to be in an area and they do not have the proper credentials, do not help them to commit a crime or put others at risk by allowing that person into a secured area.   Many people who wish to commit criminal acts have a difficult time keeping their back story on track. In this case, the subject inquired about a laundry room and a job before trying to solicit money. If someone�s story seems convoluted or complex, keep in mind that person probably has a single purpose. Boil their story down to that item and you will get a clear picture of their intentions.   I would also like to point out that solicitation on campus is a violation of the UT System Regent Rules and Regulations. That being said, once an unauthorized person asks for money, they have violated that rule and are no longer a welcome guest on the UT Campus. The police should be contacted to investigate the situation and take appropriate action.   Finally � and by all means, most importantly. The fact this subject entered an occupied dormitory room and closed the door behind him sends chills down my spine. This case could have turned out much worse. Students; please, I beg of you � DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DORMITORY ROOM DOOR OR APARTMENT DOORS & WINDOWS UNLOCKED. Keep your doors and windows closed and locked at all times.   700 Colorado Street  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was observed stumbling as he attempted to walk. The subject continued his bumbling gait into a construction site where he finally lost his balance to the point he fell into a wall. The officer stopped the subject and quickly learned the subject�s battle with gravity was not over as the officer had to literally catch the subject and hold him up. The subject was found to be under the influence of an intoxicating liquid to the point he was a danger to himself and others. Occurred on 11/04/14 at 1:07 AM.  2400 San Jacinto  Speeding / Assist Outside Agency / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A non-UT subject was stopped for speeding while driving a silver colored Mitsubishi 2-door. The subject was found to have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for theft. The subject was also found to be in possession of a small pipe containing burned marijuana residue. Occurred on 11/04/14 at 4:50 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 22 Alarm Reports, 1 �Police Help� Callbox Activation, 9 Suspicious Activity Reports, 10 Traffic Violations, 1 Motor Vehicle Collision, 5 Unsecured Door Reports, 1 Gas Leak, 2 Medical Emergency Reports, 2 Found Property Reports and 8 Public Assist Report between 11/03/14 and 11/04/14.

Occurred on 11/04/14 at 10:33 AM.  UNION BUILDING, 2304 Whitis  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was reported as entering private offices and spitting on the floor. The subject was located by the dining area and it was discovered he had previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning.

When the officer inquired about such an action, the subject exclaimed �Let me get that� and reclaimed that which was his. Occurred on 11/04/14 at 12:15 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 24 Alarm Reports, 7 Suspicious Activity Reports, 5 Traffic Violations, 3 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 4 Unsecured Door Reports, 2 Medical Emergency Reports, 1 Welfare Concern Report and 10 Public Assist Report between 11/04/14 and 11/05/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Wednesday, 11/05/14 and Thursday, 11/06/14.  ART BUILDING, 2301 San Jacinto  Theft / Credit Card Abuse: A UT faculty member left her office unsecured to attend a meeting. When the faculty member returned to her office, she discovered her computer keyboard and computer mouse had been stolen. That discovery led her to check her purse to which she discovered her wallet containing her driver� s license, two credit cards and one debit card had been stolen. The faculty member immediately checked her financial accounts and discovered two unauthorized charges had already been made at two different stores. Occurred on 11/05/14 between 11:00 AM and 12:15 PM.  Crime Prevention Tip: 1 hour and 15 minutes. That is all it took for a thief to enter an unsecured room on campus, steal three items, make it to two different stores south east of Lady Bird Lake and make two unauthorized charges on stolen credit cards. The theft probably took less than a minute. Transportation time to the two stores probably took twenty minutes. Making the unauthorized purchase took mere seconds.   Had the office door been closed and locked while the owner was away, the thief may still be looking for an opportunity to commit a theft. First and foremost, never leave your door unlocked or standing open when you are not in the office. Another thing to consider is locking your valuables in a desk drawer or cabinet at the beginning of each work day.   The victim did do something very well in this case. She contacted her credit card companies as soon as she discovered her credit cards had been stolen. This limits the amount of time the thief has to make unauthorized charges. To help do this quickly, make a list of the customer service numbers for your credit and debit card companies. Keep a copy of that list at home, another copy in your car and a third copy at your workplace.   DELL PEDIATRIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE, 1400 Barbara Jordan  Criminal Mischief: A UT staff member witnessed a subject punch a picture frame that was hung on a 1st floor corridor wall just after the subject was released from employment. The punch caused the picture frame glass to break and the frame to fall to the ground. The former employee left the scene before the arrival of the police officers. Repair cost: $10.00. Reported on 11/05/14 at 2:03 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 21 Alarm Reports, 1 �Police Help� Callbox Activation, 5 Suspicious Activity Reports, 4 Traffic Violations, 1 Medical Emergency Report, 3 Welfare Concern Reports and 11 Public Assist Report between 11/05/14 and 11/06/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Thursday, 11/06/14 and Friday, 11/07/14.  ****Austin Crime Alert****  Recently, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department learned of two unrelated robberies that happened near the 40 acres. A robbery is when someone uses force or the threat of force or displays a weapon in the process of committing a theft or felony. One case occurred in the 5th Street and Colorado area where a pedestrian was approached from behind by a subject who grabbed the victim�s wallet and ran away. That subject was described as a Black male subject in his 20�s and approximately 6� tall and was last seen wearing a maroon or red colored sweatshirt and black pants.  In the other robbery, a UT student, who was walking near his residence in the 1900 block of San Antonio Street, was approached by a Black male subject in his 20�s. The suspect displayed a weapon and demanded money. The suspect then fled the area in a gold colored Nissan Sentra with silver rims.   If you have any information regarding either of these cases, please contact the UT Police Department at 512-471-4441 or the Austin Police Department at 3-1-1.  The biggest key in preventing a robbery is being aware of your surroundings. Just what does that mean � to be aware of your surroundings? Well, first off, keep your head up. Don�t be looking at your cell phone screen or book while you are walking. Robbers love to attack those that do not see them coming. You should also be mindful of the sounds around you. Sounds like someone running or tires screeching to a halt. Of course you can�t hear such sounds if you are wearing both ear buds � that�s why we call earphones �mugger magnets.� Let one ear bud dangle; you will be much safer that way.  Walk with purpose and look at those around you. Nod to people as you walk by them. Such acknowledgment lets them know they have been seen and that you know what they look like. This is important as thieves and robbers want to surprise you. They use speed and terror as a tool in the hopes that you will not be able to provide an accurate description of them to the police. Limit what you carry with you and try to keep your hands free. Always � ALWAYS have a cell phone with you to summon police in the event of any emergency.   If a robber confronts you and demands or uses force to take your property, let that person have it � the property that is. Don�t put up a fight or resist the robber. There is nothing in your wallet that is worth risking your life over. More often than not, a robber will take the property they want and flee the area. The best thing you can do is remain calm and without starring at the robber, make a mental picture of him or her so you can provide a good description to the police. Once the robber leaves, go to a safe place and call 9-1-1 to report the robbery. Provide the description of the robber, a description of the robber�s vehicle and the last known direction of travel for the robber to the police dispatcher.   PARKING LOT 114, 2200 Leona  Burglary of Motor Vehicle: An unknown subject entered a silver colored Honda Civic 4-door and stole a Garmin Nuvi Global Position System (GPS) when the GPS device was affixed to the windshield. The dashboard was damaged when the thief removed the power cord to the GPS device. The owner of the vehicle believed he had locked his car doors when he parked the Honda. There was no evidence of forced entry into the vehicle. Loss value: $75.00. Repair cost: $50.00. Occurred between 11/06/14 at 11:30 AM and 11/07/14 at 12 midnight.   ROBERT A. WELCH HALL, 105 East 24th Street  Suspicious Activity: UT Police Officers were summoned to the bicycle racks where a UT student believed he had located his stolen bicycle at a bike rack and used his bike lock to prevent whoever secured the bike from removing the bike until Parking and Transportation Services (PTS) could confirm the ownership. As it turned out, PTS could confirm the ownership as the bicycle had been registered by the authorized owner of the bicycle prior to the student�s bike being stolen. This was the second time the UT student believed he had found his stolen bike at a bike rack and used his lock to secure the bike. Sadly, the student did not have his bicycle registered and he did not know the serial number to the bicycle. Occurred on 11/06/14 at 3:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: As you could imagine, bicycle manufacturers want to make money so they duplicate the same make, model and color of bicycles for sale � repeatedly. The only positive identifier on a bicycle is the unique serial number for the bicycle or an owner applied number like a state issued driver�s license number stamped into the frame. In this case, the victim did not have either for his stolen bicycle making it difficult to prove ownership. To help locate and identify your bicycle or to prove ownership of your bicycle when someone else believes your bike is their stolen bike, get it registered today. Bicycle registration captures the make, model, color and serial number of your bicycle which helps establish ownership. Bicycle registration is free and is required for any bicycle operated or parked on the campus. Bicycle registration can be done on-line at: http://www.utexas.edu/parking/bike/    SAN JACINTO PARKING GARAGE, 2401 San Jacinto  Criminal Mischief: The exit gate located on the 3rd floor exit off of Trinity Street was manually forced open. A review of the garage�s video surveillance footage showed a male subject driving a white Volvo station wagon approaching several gates in an attempt to exit the garage. The subject then drove up to the 3rd floor exit gate and got out of his vehicle. The subject then pushed the exit gate open before leaving the garage. This manual operation of the gate damaged the exit gate�s motor. Repair cost: $150.00. Occurred on 11/06/14 at 1:58 AM.  UNION BUILDING, 2308 Whitis  Public Intoxication: A UT student was reported as being intoxicated in the Cactus Caf�. The responding officers learned from the building manager that the subject needed to use several inanimate objects and a few animate ones to maintain his balance and state of vertical positioning. Officers asked the subject to call a friend who could care for him and after several attempts; the subject admitted he was unable to figure out how to turn on his cell phone. The subject was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point he was a danger to himself and others. Occurred on 11/06/14 at 7:00 PM.  UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Harassment: A UT student came to the police department to report being contacted several times by a former acquaintance of hers who is also a UT student. The student advised she directed the other student to stop contacting her. The other student continued to make contact with her through her social media sites and in person. Reported on 11/06/14 at 1:09 PM.  UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING, 1616 Guadalupe  Graffiti: A black permanent marker was used to write a word on a stairwell wall located on the 7th floor of the building. Removal cost: $30.00. Reported on 11/06/14 at 1:43 PM.  2400 Nueces  Disorderly Conduct � Fighting in Public (2 counts) / Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor (2 Counts): A UT police officer observed two UT students, who were both under the age of 21, engaged in a physical struggle. The investigation revealed the argument began over the fact one of the two students was from California. One of the two students admitted to being drunk while the other stated he had �a little� to drink. Neither student wished to file charges for assault. After being cited, both students were turned over to sober, responsible friends who agreed to assume care custody and control of them. Occurred on 11/07/14 at 1:05 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 23 Alarm Reports, 1 �Police Help� Callbox Activation, 7 Suspicious Activity Reports, 4 Traffic Violations, 1 Motor Vehicle Collision, 2 Medical Emergency Reports, 1 Accidental Damage Report, 3 Welfare Concern Reports and 5 Public Assist Report between 11/06/14 and 11/07/14.

Don�t put up a fight or resist the robber. There is nothing in your wallet that is worth risking your life over. More often than not, a robber will take the property they want and flee the area. The best thing you can do is remain calm and without starring at the robber, make a mental picture of him or her so you can provide a good description to the police. Once the robber leaves, go to a safe place and call 9-1-1 to report the robbery. Provide the description of the robber, a description of the robber�s vehicle and the last known direction of travel for the robber to the police dispatcher.   AT&T EXECUTIVE EDUCATION & CONFERENCE CENTER, 1900 University  Disorderly Conduct � Language / Assault by Contact: A staff member asked two patrons to leave the 1st floor restaurant after one of the patrons directed a member of the wait staff to do something offensive. When the patrons refused to leave, a staff supervisor was summoned to scene and was promptly shoved in the chest by one of the patrons. That patron also ripped the supervisor�s name tag from his shirt. The patrons left the restaurant and summoned a taxi cab before the arrival of the police officers. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 7:20 PM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Public Intoxication: A UT student was reported as being intoxicated to the point he was falling on people in section 27 of the stadium. The student was easy to locate as he continued to have challenges with gravity as the officer approached. A sober friend was summoned to take care, custody and control of the subject who was ejected from the stadium. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 3:06 PM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor / Possession of Fictitious License: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was reported as experiencing a bout of intestinal protest while inside a ground floor restroom during the Longhorn victory over the Mountaineers. The student showed other signs of having previously consumed alcoholic beverages. When asked for her license, the student handed the officer a fictitious driver�s license which purported the student to be of legal drinking age. After a check of the driver�s license showed no such name and date of birth in the database, the student admitted the license was a fake. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 5:00 PM.  GATES DELL COMPLEX, 2317 Speedway  Public Intoxication / Evading Arrest or Detention: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was observed stumbling and staggering through the bushes located on the west side of the building. When the observing officer initiated a pedestrian stop, the student felt it better to flee from the officer. The student soon realized he was wrong to run when he tripped over a decorative lawn chain, got up and continued to run before tripping over a second decorative lawn chain. Once stopped, the student admitted to having consumed too much alcohol. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 1:25 AM.  GREGORY GYMNASIUM, 2101 Speedway  Theft: A UT student placed his backpack inside an unsecured 2nd floor men�s locker room then left to get a workout in.

The student checked the contents of the backpack and discovered his black Prada wallet containing $450.00 in cash, several debit cards and his Texas Driver�s license had been stolen from the backpack. Loss value: $650.00. Occurred on 11/06/14 between 4:45 PM and 6:15 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Wow � a wallet with a fair market value of some $200 and $450 in cash just left in an unsecured locker. To think, even a $5 lock could have prevented this theft. Don�t make a thief�s job easy � make the thief work for what he or she gets. If the work is tough enough, maybe the thief will go out and get a regular job. A locker is only good if it is locked (maybe that�s why they call it a locker and not a cabinet).   JESTER ACADEMIC CENTER, 201 East 21st Street  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was reported as asking people for money inside the building. When the subject was located, it was discovered he had previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning. The subject was taken into custody for criminal trespass.

Occurred on 11/08/14 at 1:54 AM.   JESTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor: A UT staff member reported a resident needed to assist another resident into the dormitory due to the level of the other resident�s blood alcohol concentration level.

Both subjects were located and stopped. Neither subject was in possession of a firearm. One of the two subjects had evidence down his front side of having experienced a severe involuntary reaction to the over-consumption of an alcoholic beverage. That subject was unable to stand without support and was deemed to be intoxicated to the point he was a physical danger to himself. The other subject admitted to being in possession of alcohol and produced a twelve pack of beer. That same subject was also found to have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for an attempted burglary of a habitation. During a search incidental to arrest, that same subject was found to be in possession of .02 ounces of marijuana, several plastic baggies and an electronic scale. In addition to other law enforcement action taken, both subjects were issued a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 8:55 PM.   PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Evading Arrest or Detention: UT Police Officers responded to a report of a subject yelling at people on the plaza located on the north side of the library. The first officer on scene had no problems locating the subject as he was following a group of five and yelling loudly at them. When the officer directed the subject to stop, he declined and commented that he did not wish to be bothered before he began yelling once more � ironic �don�t you think. The officer then placed a verbal order for the subject to stop which too went ignored as the subject proceeded to pass the officer. Once a second officer arrived, the two officers were able to bring the subject�s boisterous jaunt to an end. Occurred on 11/07/14 at 11:01 PM.  RECREATIONAL SPORTS CENTER, 2001 San Jacinto  Public Intoxication: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was reported as being passed on a retaining wall located on the west side of the building. The student was found with evidence of the evening�s intake on his shirt, pants and shoes. Apparently his intake was substantial as he continued to produce such evidence throughout the interview. The student�s pants also showed he had previously experienced a great urge but did not have the motor skills or control to prevent another release before he was prepared to do so. After the student refused treatment by Austin-Travis County EMS, he was turned over to a sober, responsible adult who was willing to care for and hopefully clean-up the student � now that�s a friend. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 6:33 PM.   SAN ANTONIO PARKING GARAGE, 2420 San Antonio  Duty Upon Striking an Unattended Vehicle: An unknown vehicle struck the left rear door of a parked VW Jetta while the Jetta was parked on the 7th level of the garage.

Occurred between 11/08/14 at 2:00 PM and 11/09/14 at 6:45 PM.  SPEEDWAY PARKING GARAGE, 2700 Speedway  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was found slumped over the steps leading to the north east side of the parking garage. When awakened the subject attempted to stand and was subsequently spared an injury by the officer who caught the now falling subject. For her efforts, the subject yelled, �Get away from me girl.� Once the intoxicated subject realized he did not have the mental capacity or manual dexterity to place a call to a sober person, he exclaimed, �Take me to jail!� Wish granted. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 4:25 PM.  UNION BUILDING, 2308 Whitis  Possession of Marijuana: Two UT students were reported as smoking marijuana on the north patio of the building. The responding officer followed his nose to one of the two students who subsequently produced a plastic bag containing .078 ounces of marijuana from her left coat pocket. The chivalrous student exclaimed the other student had nothing to do with the marijuana. Occurred on 11/07/14 at 4:13 PM.  UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Fraudulent Use of Possession of Identifying Information: A UT student contacted the UT Police Department to report personal information from his stolen cellular telephone had been used to take out a loan at a bank in Los Angeles, California. The student advised his Apple iPhone 5 had been stolen when her left it in a Las Vegas cab on 07/11/14 between 11:30 PM and 12 midnight. Reported on 11/07/14 at 5:28 PM. Crime Prevention Tip:  Once your identity has been compromised, your good name and credit are subject to criminal activity for years to follow. That being said, take every measure to assure your identifying information is secured. This is especially problematic with so many people keeping such information on their electronic devices. If your good name and credit information resides on your phone, then treat your phone like cash � never leave it unattended or accessible to a thief. Also, make sure you keep your electronics password protected and look into tracking software for items like your phone, laptop and tablet. Some of these programs are pre-installed but must be activated before your device is stolen. A few of these security features also have a remote data wipe feature that allows you to eliminate any data on the device remotely.   UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Credit / Debit Card Abuse: A UT student came to the police department to report several unauthorized charges totaling $1,816.82 made against her bank account debit card. The student was in possession of the debit card. The student recognized the unauthorized charges while inspecting her account. Occurred on 11/06/14.  Crime Prevention Tip: With the ever growing use of �ones and zeroes� to code our entire existence, the risk of identity theft and electronic fraud multiplies exponentially. In today�s high tech crime world, a thief can hack your electronic information and take control of your accounts or even your good name with just a few keystrokes. You must be diligent with every on-line transaction.  Make sure you do on-line business with companies offering secure check out services. Keep your own hardware and software secure and up-to-date. Don�t make your computer, laptop, cellular device or any electronic contraption � even your gaming system � accessible to a thief. Keep your security software up-to-date; don�t just �x out� that alert that your security software is out of date.  Check your accounts frequently for any suspicious transactions. As soon as you detect an odd transaction or one you don�t recall � look into it and cancel your cards immediately when you discover an unauthorized transaction.  Mind your mail � yes your snail mail. Often times an identity thief will dumpster dive for discarded financial statements. Some thieves even steal your mail right out of your mailbox. If you didn�t receive a bill on time, then take action. Contact the financial institution to see about the bill and inspect your recent charges against that account.   WALTER WEBB HALL, 2500 Guadalupe  Graffiti: A currently unknown subject used paint rollers, orange paint, and white spray paint to paint a large image on the east exterior wall of the building. The �street artist� left behind all of his or her art supplies including a leaking can of paint and a drop cloth. Removal cost: $100.00. Reported on 11/08/14 at 11:38 PM.  1700 San Jacinto  Public Intoxication: A UT student was found passed out while seated on the side of the road. Once awakened, the student showed so many classic signs of intoxication it may be hard to illustrate them all here � but let�s give it a try. In addition to having difficulty standing to the point the officer insisted he just stay seated, the student handed the officer an insurance card when asked for a driver�s license. The student recalled he had 4 or 5 beers but could not recall the type and more importantly the size of the beers (we are guessing they were large beers). The student had difficulty with time and space as he estimated the time he was passed out to be �100 micrometers.� The student believed he was currently on 6th street and that he was 1 by 5 blocks from his residence. The student was found to be under the influence of an intoxicating liquid to the point he was deemed to be a danger to himself. Occurred on 11/08/14 at 4:48 AM.  2100 San Jacinto  Assault: A fan of UT football approached an officer and reported that while he and his brother-in-law were walking toward the stadium for the football game, they were approached by an obvious fan of the West Virginia Mountaineers who had been heckling other football patrons (I�m guessing the fan from West Virginia believed that the Mountaineers would win). The Mountaineer fan punched the reporting person�s brother-in-law in the face. The brother-in-law decided to forego the game and left the area. The reporting person was able to capture an image of the suspect who was described as a White male, heavyset with light facial hair and wearing blue and yellow stripped overalls, a dark blue t-shirt, a green hat and holding a beer. Reported on 11/08/14 at 2:46 PM.   2300 San Jacinto  Public Intoxication: A UT student was observed having difficulty sitting upright while on a bus stop bench. As the officer approached the student, she began to exhibit an adverse reaction to the consumption of alcohol. The student had a difficult time with estimating the amount or type of alcohol she had consumed and was not confident in her current location or the coordinates of her preferred destination. While the student was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point she was a danger to herself, she was turned over to a sober family member who arrived to assume care, custody and control of her. Occurred on 11/09/14 at 3:38 AM.   The University of Texas Police Department responded to 107 Alarm Reports, 2 �Police Help� Callbox Activations, 1 Fire Alarm Activation, 29 Suspicious Activity Reports, 14 Traffic Violations, 2 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 2 Medical Emergency Reports, 1 Water Main Break, 6 Welfare Concern Reports, 2 Found Property Reports, 5 Unsecured Door Reports and 17 Public Assist Reports between 11/07/14 and 11/10/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Monday, 11/10/14 and Tuesday, 11/11/14.  ****Austin Crime Alert****  Recently, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department learned of two unrelated robberies that happened near the 40 acres. A robbery is when someone uses force or the threat of force or displays a weapon in the process of committing a theft or felony. One case occurred in the 5th Street and Colorado area where a pedestrian was approached from behind by a subject who grabbed the victim�s wallet and ran away. That subject was described as a Black male subject in his 20�s and approximately 6� tall and was last seen wearing a maroon or red colored sweatshirt and black pants.   In the other robbery, a UT student, who was walking near his residence in the 1900 block of San Antonio Street, was approached by a Black male subject in his 20�s who was approximately 5�9� tall with a goatee and wearing a grey hoodie. The suspect displayed a weapon and demanded money. The suspect then fled the area in a gold colored Nissan Altima with silver rims in the shape of a 5-pointed star.   If you have any information regarding either of these cases, please contact the UT Police Department at 512-471-4441 or the Austin Police Department at 3-1-1.  The biggest key in preventing a robbery is being aware of your surroundings. Just what does that mean � to be aware of your surroundings? Well, first off, keep your head up. Don�t be looking at your cell phone screen or book while you are walking. Robbers love to attack those that do not see them coming. You should also be mindful of the sounds around you. Sounds like someone running or tires screeching to a halt. Of course you can�t hear such sounds if you are wearing both ear buds � that�s why we call earphones �mugger magnets.� Let one ear bud dangle; you will be much safer that way.  Walk with purpose and look at those around you. Nod to people as you walk by them. Such acknowledgment lets them know they have been seen and that you know what they look like. This is important as thieves and robbers want to surprise you. They use speed and terror as a tool in the hopes that you will not be able to provide an accurate description of them to the police. Limit what you carry with you and try to keep your hands free. Always � ALWAYS have a cell phone with you to summon police in the event of any emergency.   If a robber confronts you and demands or uses force to take your property, let that person have it � the property that is. Don�t put up a fight or resist the robber. There is nothing in your wallet that is worth risking your life over. More often than not, a robber will take the property they want and flee the area. The best thing you can do is remain calm and without starring at the robber, make a mental picture of him or her so you can provide a good description to the police. Once the robber leaves, go to a safe place and call 9-1-1 to report the robbery. Provide the description of the robber, a description of the robber�s vehicle and the last known direction of travel for the robber to the police dispatcher.   ART BUILDING, 2301 San Jacinto  Theft: A media cart containing a grey colored Mac Mini computer, an Epson projector, black computer speakers, two computer keyboards and a computer mouse was stolen from a 1st floor room.

The subject then placed his hand on her lower back and pulled her toward him in an attempt to kiss her. The student pulled free and left the area. Based on the reporting person�s description of the subject, responding officers located the subject as the subject was exiting the building. During the investigation, a second UT student approached the officers and advised that the subject had engaged her in the same unwanted flirtation and touches. Before being booked into jail, the subject was also issued a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 11/10/14 at 6:40 PM.  UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Suspicious Activity: A UT student came to the police department and reported his spouse had received a telephone call from an unknown person. The caller asked his spouse for the reporting person�s date of birth and social security number. The spouse provided the caller with the reporting person�s telephone number. The caller then telephoned the reporting person claiming to be with a �communication company� and asked the reporting person for his date of birth and social security number. The reporting person recognized this as suspicious and refused to provide such information before disconnecting the call. Reported on 11/10/14 at 6:18 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: The reporting person, and his spouse did a great job handling this situation. You should never provide your personal information; like your date of birth or social security number, to an unsolicited caller.   24th Street and San Antonio  Indecent Exposure: A UT staff member reported being approached by a male subject as she was walking to work. The male subject was holding something in his hand that shall not be mentioned here. The subject attempted to engage the staff member in conversation but she continued to walk � no doubt at a more brisk pace. The staff member provided officers with a description of the suspect who was quickly located by the UT Police Department�s Bike Patrol Unit. It is safe to say the suspect was not near as happy to see the officers. Occurred on 11/10/14 at approximately 7:00 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 26 Alarm Reports, 2 �Police Help� Callbox Activations, 9 Suspicious Activity Reports, 9 Traffic Violations, 1 Medical Emergency Report, 1 Welfare Concern Report, 3 Found Property Reports and 3 Public Assist Reports between 11/10/14 and 11/11/14.

The officer located three UT students inside the room. The resident of the room denied smoking marijuana but confessed to possessing marijuana and produced three hand rolled cigarettes containing a total of .08 ounces of marijuana. Occurred on 11/12/14 at 12:47 AM.  PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Public Intoxication / Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject was reported as lying on the ground in the middle of the 2nd floor of the library. When located, the front of the subject�s pants indicated he had consumed too much alcohol as much if it had to escape his body. The subject was found to be under the influence of an intoxicating liquid to the point Austin-Travis County EMS needed to transport the subject to a local hospital for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. Prior to his departure, the subject was issued a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 11/11/14 at 2:26 PM.  PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Criminal Trespass Warning: UT Police Officers responded to the 2nd floor computer lab to investigate a report of one non-UT subject feeling threatened by the presence of another non-UT subject. The reporting person had issues with the other subject in the past and now the other subject was glaring at him in the library. The other subject had no stated purpose for being in the library and was issued a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 11/11/14 at 12:51 PM.  PRATHER HALL DORMITORY, 305 East 21st Street  Suspicious Activity: A 3rd floor resident reported hearing someone knocking on his dormitory room door before an unknown subject opened his unlocked door. The resident stopped the subject form entering his room and the subject asked if �Tim was home.� The resident, and his roommate, Tim, have their first names posted on their door. The subject then quickly walked away. The resident went to the front desk to report the incident and noticed the subject was loitering in the K stairwell. The subject was described as a black male in his 40�s and was balding. The subject was missing some of his front teeth and was seen wearing a black jacket, black pants and carrying a red and black backpack. Occurred on 11/11/14 at 11:40 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: See below  PRATHER HALL DORMITORY, 305 East 21st Street  Burglary of Habitation: A UT student reported he had fallen asleep inside his 1st floor dormitory room and awoke several hours later to discover his Hewlett Packard laptop computer had been stolen. The door to the room was left unsecured during the time frame of the theft. Loss value: $450.00. Occurred on 11/11/12 between 4:00 AM and 1:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: There are two main contributing factors to crime in the dormitories. The first is residents allowing people to follow them through card reader controlled doors � or even worse, holding the door open for people they do not know. The card reader doors are there to regulate access into the dormitory. Residents, if you do not know the person belongs on the floor or dormitory, do not let them follow you through a card reader door. If you do not want to confront the person, simply don�t go through the card reader door � walk away and call the police department to report a suspicious person. The second issue that leads to crime in the dormitory is people leaving their dormitory room door unlocked or open. Burglars love unsecured doors and windows. Most home invasions happen when someone leaves a door or window open or unlocked. You should keep your dormitory room door closed and locked at all times; even if you are in your room. Talk about these concerns with your roommate and make a pact to keep your dormitory room secured.   SAN ANTONIO PARKING GARAGE, 2420 San Antonio  Criminal Mischief: A currently unknown subject broke the exit control arm from the exit gate located on the northwest side of the parking garage.

Loss value: $250.00. Occurred on 11/11/14 between 4:17 PM and 4:20 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 25 Alarm Reports, 6 Suspicious Activity Reports, 1 Suspicious Odor Report, 10 Traffic Violations, 2 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 1 Medical Emergency Report, 1 Welfare Concern Report, 1 Water Leak Report and 6 Public Assist Reports between 11/11/14 and 11/12/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Monday, 11/17/14 and Tuesday, 11/18/14.

FACILITIES COMPLEX 1, 1301 East Dean Keeton

Scam: A UT staff member received a suspicious telephone call from a subject who claimed to be the �university�s copy machine representative.� The caller ID showed the call was �anonymous.� The caller asked the staff member for the serial number to their office�s copy machine. When the staff member told the caller she believed he was deceiving her, the caller disconnected the call. The staff member, a faithful reader of The Campus Watch, used the STAR 57 feature on her campus telephone to trap the number of the caller. Reported on 11/17/14 at 1:17 PM.
Crime Prevention Tips:
They say knowledge is power and I believe this case illustrates that adage well. The reporting person recognized this call to be suspicious and I like to think it is because we have seen this scam in previous editions of The Campus Watch. In this scam, the caller obtains information about your copier, and typically the supply manager information before sending low quality products with a bogus purchase order in the hopes the office will just blindly pay for the equipment. Once the reporting person called the caller out � he disconnected the call. 
Another example of knowledge helping to prevent and investigate crime is the reporting person�s knowledge of the STAR 57 feature on campus telephones. This feature allows the person who receives a suspicious telephone call on a campus phone to trap the number of the caller. It even works when the caller has an �anonymous� number. If you receive a suspicious telephone call on your desk phone and want to trap the number of the caller follow these simple steps:
- Hang the receiver up
- Pick the handset back up
- Dial *57.
You will then hear a recorded message indicating the caller�s telephone number was / was not trapped. 
If the trap was successful advise the officer who takes the report that you used *57 to trap the number of the caller.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Thursday, 11/20/14 and Friday, 11/21/14.

BRAKENRIDGE APARTMENTS, 3350 Lake Austin Blvd

Fraud: A UT student reported receiving a telephone call from a person claiming to be a local police officer. The caller ID on the call did show a City of Austin Police Department number which was no doubt cloned. The caller stated he was working with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a �back taxes� investigation and that the student needed to pay $2,000.00 in back taxes to avoid being arrested. After the student advised he did not have $2,000.00, the caller turned the call over to another subject who claimed to be an attorney with the IRS. That person demanded the student remain on the line as they worked out a �payment plan� or the student would be arrested for ceasing an �official government call.� Four hours later, the student and the �attorney� � or as I should refer to him, the scam artist � worked out a payment plan in which the student was directed to go to a near-by CVS and obtain three Green Dot cards in the amount of $935.00. Once the Green Dot cards were purchased, the caller demanded the student card access numbers listed on the back of the card. The call was then disconnected. Occurred on 11/19/14 between 12 noon and 4:00 PM.
Crime Prevention Tip:
This is becoming a very common scam. This will continue to be a popular scam until enough people know about it to the point it is no longer effective for the scam artists. That being said, we need to share this scam information with everyone we know so that they do not fall victim to this scam. Please forward it, print and post it, discuss it, Morse Code it, Pony Express it, coffee klatch it, smoke signal it � just spread it out. 
This is a scam. The caller uses the fear of arrest to get the victims to comply and purchase Green Dot cards (a form of pre-paid debit cards). Once the Green Dot cards have been purchased, the caller demands the access codes on the back of the card. With the access codes, the caller can make electronic purchases and financial transfers that are not traceable. 
To gain the victim�s confidence, the caller will use a cloned police department telephone number and provide identifying information about the victim to the victim. Often times that shared identifying information is simple data found in directories or phone books. 
The caller in these cases will keep you on the line until you provide them the Green Dot access codes. 
The U.S. Federal Government does not obtain money over the phone via Green Dot cards. If you get a call like this, then all you need to do is hang up and call the police department to make a report. Trust me - if you do owe back taxes, then the IRS will make an official contact.
We have also seen similar scams in which the caller claims to be investigating a tuition violation and demands a money payment through Green Dot card access codes over the phone.

Occurred on 11/24/14 at 11:15 PM. Safety Tip: So many people think motor scooters and bicycles are exempt from traffic laws so they operate their chosen form of transportation without any regard for the laws of this great state or for safety in general. In Texas, scooters and bicycles should be operated just like a car. As an operator of these two wheeled devices, you need to stop at stop signs and red lights; you need to use a headlamp at night; you need to refrain from exceeding the posted speed limit; you need to drive on the right side of the roadway�I could recite the vast majority of the Texas Transportation Code but I am hoping you get the message. To keep everyone safe on Texas roadways, we all need to follow the laws.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 18 Alarm Reports, 5 Suspicious Activity Reports, 14 Traffic Violations, 1 Collision Report, 2 Medical Emergencies, 2 Unsecured Door Reports and 1 Public Assist Report between 11/24/14 and 11/25/14.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Tuesday, 11/25/14 and Wednesday, 11/26/14  Travel Safety Tips  Throughout the week people will be flooding the roadways, streets, sidewalks, railways, flying the friendly skies and hoisting anchors to meet up with friends and family to share in giving thanks. Before we make our voyages, consider the following travel safety tips: - Before leaving, take care of your residence and the property you are leaving behind. Move your bicycle inside. Move your property form your porch inside. Have your mail and newspapers held until next week or have a trusted friend pick-up these tell-tale signs that you are not home. Make sure to drip your faucets before leaving as you never know when a freak freeze may happen in Texas. Check out a timer form the UT Police Department. A timer can be used to turn lights, radios etc. on and off throughout your vacation. This gives the impression you are at home.  - Check your car�s essentials. Make sure the tires are properly inflated and the oil, transmission, radiator and wiper fluid levels are filled to the proper level. - Stock your car. Put a cell phone charger, a roll of paper towels, a blanket and some snacks in your vehicle.  - Plan your trip out ahead of time so you don�t have unattended surprises with the route. - Let people know your schedule so they know to start checking if you don�t show up on time. - Be a good driver! I cannot stress this enough. Collisions on our roadways always seem to go up during holiday weekends. There are many causes for this but the two primary ones are driving while intoxicated and distracted driving. I know all of you have already been directed to not drink and drive but the reinforcement of that suggested is warranted each and every day. Do not let the holiday libations make you or someone else less thankful. With regard to distracted driving, it is every bit as dangerous as driving while intoxicated. That is why I am happy to share that many municipalities are taking this issue up through local ordinances that ban cell phone, GPS and other electronic device usage while driving. The City Of Austin recently passed a city ordinance that will take effect on the first of January. This ordinance bans the manual dialing and deactivation of cell phone calls, participating in a call in which you hold the phone to your ear, viewing or sending any electronic data or entering or changing any information on a GPS while the motor vehicle OR bicycle is in motion. Any violation of this ordinance within the City of Austin could result in a Class C Misdemeanor charge. While this city ordinance does not take effect until January, let�s all dedicate ourselves to self-impose these mandates starting today. If someone asks you what present you would like this season � ask for a hands-free system for your car.   BERNARD & AUDRE RAPOPORT BUILDING, 2225 Speedway  Theft / Credit Card Abuse: A wallet containing $100.00 in cash, two forms of identification and six debit or credit cards was stolen from an unsecured 3rd floor office while the owner was out of the office.

The student was belligerent to the sober people who were trying to assist and to the Housing and Food Staff member who was also trying to assist. The intoxicated student�s attitude did not improve with the interjection of responding police officers. The student admitted he had �a little to drink� and did not want �consequences for his actions� as they were not his fault. The student came very close to being arrested for public intoxication but the very patient officers decided to issue a citation for the consumption of alcohol by a minor and release the student to his sober party. Occurred on 12/02/14 at 1:21 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: You will often read in the Campus Watch that we recommend you have a sober friend go with you when you go out drinking. This is always a good idea � that person can keep you out of jail or more importantly out of the hospital. Keep in mind, if you become so intoxicated the police do not believe your sober friend can care for you then you might end up going to jail anyway. There are two tips here. First, always have a sober friend with you. Second, know your limits and don�t exceed them.   KINSOLVING DORMITORY, 2605 Whitis  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was reported as sleeping on the benches located on the west side of the dormitory.

This is a free service that allows you to log the make, model, color and serial number of your property.

Occurred between 11/21/14 and 12/11/14 at 1:30 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: So it is evident a u-lock is effective theft prevention, but it will only protect that which it used to secure � in this case, the front wheel. To protect your bicycle, use a u-lock but make sure you are securing the bicycle frame and front wheel to the bicycle rack.   AT&T EXECUTIVE EDUCATION & CONFERENCE CENTER, 1900 University  Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject refused to leave the property after being directed to do so by AT&T Conference Center staff members.

In all, the two students were found to be in possession of .17 ounces of marijuana and three pipes that are commonly used to smoke marijuana.

The officer smartly remained with the remaining three subjects who quickly gave up the name of the fleeing subject. Once more, the UT student called the fleeing subject by phone and convinced him to return to the scene. No damage could be detected on the fixed object. In addition to other law enforcement action taken, the three non-UT subjects were issued written criminal trespass warnings. Occurred on 12/15/14 at 4:45 AM.  GOLDSMITH HALL, 310 Inner Campus Drive  Theft: A black Incase backpack containing a silver colored MacBook Pro, a computer mouse, a camera memory card, two different video adaptors, and a power cord was stolen when the backpack was left �several feet� away from the owner who was standing near the south entrance to the building. Loss value: $1,300.00. Occurred on 12/11/14 between 3:00 PM and 3:25 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: We often believe our property is protected if we are �in the area� or same room as our property. Sadly, all a thief needs is a second or two of inattention to steal your property. To protect your property keep it with you at all times.   GREGORY GYMNASIUM, 2101 Speedway  Theft: A light blue wallet containing a debit card, a credit card, a one dollar bill, a key fob and two forms of identification was stolen while it was left on the floor of the cardio work-out room as the owner exercised.

Loss value: $800.00. Occurred on 12/11/14 between 5:13 AM and 8:30 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: I am not even going to address leaving your property unattended here (for nearly three hours). Instead, I want to focus on the benefits of knowing the serial number to your property. The serial number is a unique number given to individual pieces of property. Most electronics have a serial number as do bicycles. If you provide the police with the serial number to your property when it is lost or stolen, they can use that information to help locate and positively identify your property as belonging to you. They can check pawn shops and enter your property as stolen in a crime database that is accessible to law enforcement state and nation-wide. I understand most of us do not maintain a log of the serial numbers to our property. That is why the UT Police Department developed an on-line database for you to log the serial numbers. This is a free service that can be accessed by visiting our website at www.utexas.edu/police.  PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Theft: A Dell laptop computer was stolen after it was left on a study table located on the 5th floor of the library.

Reported on 12/12/14 at 12:48 PM.  PERRY-CASTA�EDA LIBRARY, 101 East 21st Street  Criminal Trespass: A UT student reported seeing a subject, who was wearing a backpack, pick up an unattended backpack on the 5th floor and walk away. A non-UT subject matching the description given by the reporting person was located on the 2nd floor. That subject was found to have previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning. While the subject was no longer in possession of the unattended backpack, he was in possession of another person�s wallet and identification. The owner of the wallet has not come forward to file a theft report. Occurred on 12/14/14 at 11:20 AM.  TOWNES HALL, 727 East Dean Keeton  Credit Card Abuse: A UT staff member reported that her wallet has been missing for several days.

Loss value: $50.00. Occurred on 12/10/14 between 8:30 AM and 5:30 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: The UT Police Department recommends the use of a cable lock and u-lock to secure your bicycle for the primary reason of criminal laziness as they do not want to defeat two different types of locks to steal a bicycle. A secondary benefit to using both types of locks is that a u-lock can be used to secure the front wheel and frame to a bicycle rack while a cable lock can be used to secure the rear wheel and frame to the bicycle rack.  Oh, and for any thieves who may be reading this, just because you left replacement items for the victim does not mean you didn�t commit a theft.   2300 San Jacinto  Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor / Possession of More Than One Valid Driver�s License: A non-UT subject, who was under the age of 21, was found sleeping on a bench. The subject stated he had been drinking with friends at downtown bars and had gotten separated from his friends.

When stopped the subject was determined to be intoxicated to the point he was unaware of simple concepts like the day of month. The time traveler became restless as the officers began to initiate arrest procedures and exclaimed �*%#@ this� and tried to run across Guadalupe Street. Based on the earlier description of his coordination you can imagine it was a short chase. Once in custody, the subject was found to be in possession of a new shirt from a near-by retailer. An investigation showed the shirt had not been purchased before it was removed from the store. Recovery value: $25.00. Occurred on 12/15/14 at 11:13 AM.  1600 San Antonio  Driving While Intoxicated / Possession of Marijuana: A non-UT subject was observed driving on the wrong side of the road before turning onto another road and driving the wrong way on a one-way roadway.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Wednesday, 12/17/14 and Thursday, 12/18/14.  �tis the Season for Tips With the holiday season in full swing, we have been inundated with request to put information from different sources regarding holiday safety and prevention tips. One source is from State Farm Insurance. If you would like to review their tips, visit: http://learningcenter.statefarm.com/family/finances/common-holiday-scams-to-avoid/index.html?cmpid=enews-dec14  Another request comes to us from our brothers and sisters in blue at The Austin Police Department. Their tips included:  The Austin Police Department Burglary Unit would like to remind Austin citizens that the period immediately after Thanksgiving and Christmas typically sparks a rise in burglaries. In order to help keep your possessions safe, APD�s Burglary Unit would like to remind you of the following:  o Break down all boxes from your gifts and place them in a dark colored trash bag or a closed trash container to avoid burglars knowing there are new items in your residence  o Close window shades and blinds when no one is home to prevent burglars from window shopping in your home  o Close and lock all windows and doors prior to leaving your residence  o Secure all valuables from immediate view such as laptops, cellphones, wallets, etc.; if a burglar looks in and sees a laptop close to the door or window, it becomes an easy target  o Close and lock your garage, as well as any storage sheds, on your property  o Record all serial numbers of valuables so that police can have the opportunity to try to recover your property if it is stolen; if you keep your list in an electronic device, ensure you have a printed copy available in the event your device is stolen  o Call in suspicious persons and vehicles to 911 immediately, so that officers can identify the intentions of the person and/or vehicle in your neighborhood  The University of Texas at Austin Police Department would like to add some reminders for safe partying and DWI prevention. During this festive time of year, many people partake in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. To help keep you safe while consuming, consider the following: - Don�t take your car if you plan to drink. That way you won�t be tempted to drive. Have sober friend or take a cab. - Know your limits and stay within those limits. A sober friend can help with this too. - Eat something before you go out and throughout the night. - Alternate alcoholic beverages with non-alcoholic ones (preferably water).  - Mind your drink � only accept a drink from a wait staff member or a bar tender. Once you set your drink down forsake it and order a new one. Watch people�s hands as they move anywhere around your drink. If someone else�s hands move too close to your drink � forsake that drink and order a new one.  This time of year is all about being thankful for the life you have and celebrating that life, reminiscing about the past and preparing for a bright future. By taking precautions when it comes to your alcohol use in the last days of 2014, you can secure your future celebrations in 2015.   ART BUILDING, 2301 San Jacinto  Theft: A 5� Dewalt orbital sander and extension cord were stolen after they were left in an unsecured locker located in a 2nd floor hallway.

The subject was found to be under the influence of an intoxicating substance to the point she was deemed to have been driving or at least drooling while intoxicated.

The subject was then seen, or should I say heard, being verbally abusive to other patrons. The officer directed the Grinch like patron out of the arena for an interview. The non-UT subject showed several signs of intoxication. The officer felt it was best the subject leave the holiday concert early and directed him to do so. The subject became verbally abusive toward the officer and refused to leave. The subject then used physical force to prevent the officer from escorting the subject out of the venue. The ruckus continued as other officers arrived to assist. The resistance grew to the point one officer took electrifying action to stop the fray.

Such a device will not only make you a safer driver, it will also help keep you from getting a citation from the Austin Police Department�s Finest.

Any phone conversation you have while operating a car or bicycle must be hands free and absolutely no texting. Don�t dedicate yourself to hands free no texting habits because of a law � do it to be a safer driver.  So much for 2014; The 2014 Campus Watch editions are in the archives. It was a busy year to say the least. The �Best Of� compilation was much lengthier than I would have liked and I hope 2015�s is much shorter. I have attached the top ten as voted on by the reader�s.

Occurred on 01/08/14 at 11:55 AM Crime Prevention Tip: The student recognized this as the beginning of a common scam in which a caller will advise that he or she works for a law enforcement agency and will even go as far as cloning or spoofing a local police department telephone number. After the caller tells the victim they are under investigation for any number of made-up charges, the caller will tell the victim to avoid criminal charges, the victim must purchase a Green Dot card and provide the card number over the phone. Please hear me, law enforcement officers, agents and detectives should never ask you for money. If you legitimately owe money for taxes, unpaid legal fines, tuition � anything, you would make the payment to someone other than a police officer, agent or detective.   2400 University  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject, who was under the age of 21, was observed attempting to run shirtless while his pants were losing a battle with gravity.

In one scam, the scam artist, sends a fake e-mail to a university employee indicating a change in the employee�s Human Resource Status. The e-mail directs the employee to log onto their human resource web to see the change in status and provides a link that is similar in appearance to the actual web site. The scam artist then captures the employee�s log-in credentials as they log into their website. The scam artist would then use the log-on to change the employee�s paycheck bank account routing number to the thief�s bank account routing number.   In the other scam, the scammer sends an e-mail to a university student�s university e-mail address to offer a �work from home� job with a fictitious company�s payroll or human resources office. The student is then asked for their bank account routing number. A sum of money is then transferred into the student�s account. Once the money is in the student�s account, the student is directed to transfer that money into another account that is involved in the account. This is a method of the scammer using a legitimate bank account of a third party to steal money form another�s bank account.   For more information on these scams, please see the attached Public Service Announcements  ASBEL-SMITH PARKING GARAGE, 201 West 7th Street  Graffiti: A silver colored paint pen was used to write letters on the west exterior wall.

A secondary reason for using a cable lock in conjunction with a u-lock is that the cable lock can be threaded through the seat mount to provide additional security for your seat.   UNION BUILDING, 2308 Whitis  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was reported as sleeping next to a trash dumpster located on the west side of the building.

The student was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point he was deemed to have been driving while intoxicated. An open container of alcohol was found inside the vehicle. While being booked into jail, the student uttered he had also consumed a �brick.� To our knowledge, a �brick� is not a slang term for an alcoholic beverage.

At the time of the incident one of the vehicle�s 4 doors was not secured. While no items appeared to have been stolen, the contents of the vehicle�s interior had been rifled through as though the offender was looking for something to steal. Occurred on 01/28/15 between 9:30 AM and 1:40 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Aside from the obvious tips of making sure your vehicle is locked and don�t store items inside your car, allow me to take this opportunity to highlight the �Police Help� callboxes and parking garage panic buttons. These devices allow you to contact the police department with just a push of a button. The callboxes around campus are easily identified by their distinctive blue light atop a bright yellow pole. These devices allow you to communicate with the police dispatcher via a telephone line. The parking garages on campus have panic buttons which can be found by looking for a blue light. Below the light is a big red button. While the garage panic devices do not allow you to communicate with the dispatcher, the push of the button does alert the police department to someone needing assistance at that location.   MUSIC RECITAL HALL, 2405 Trinity  Failure To Identify: A UT staff member reported seeing a subject who seemed to be �hiding� in the building. The non-UT subject was not very good at hiding as officers quickly located the subject on the 6th floor. The subject provided officers with a name and date of birth that the officers discovered to be fictitious. After an investigation, the subject�s correct identity was discovered. The subject was taken to a place that is even more difficult to play hide-n-seek. In addition to other law enforcement action taken, the subject was issued a written criminal trespass warning.

January 30, 2015
Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Thursday, 01/29/15 and Friday, 01/30/15.  GUADALUPE PARKING GARAGE, 417 West 17th Street  Burglary of Motor Vehicle: An unidentified subject entered a silver colored Toyota Corolla, rifled through the vehicle�s contents and stole a parking permit. The vehicle was parked on the 4th level at the time of the burglary. Occurred on 01/29/15 between 6:30 AM and 12 Noon.  JESSE H. JONES COMMUNICATIONS CENTER, 2504-B Whitis  Theft: A navy blue Trek Lync 3 bicycle was stolen while it was secured with a cable lock to the bicycle racks located on the east side of the building.

Occurred between 01/29/15 at 10:40 AM and 01/30/15 at 1:30 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: I never understood why someone would invest so little in the protection of their valuable property. In this case, a cable lock was used to �secure� such a valuable bike. Bike thefts are not the only examples of such dichotomies. All you need to do is look to the gyms for more examples. People will leave cell phones worth hundreds of dollars on the bleachers or in unsecured day lockers. They pay so much for the phones and all the downloads on their phones but won�t invest a quarter for a paid day use locker or five dollars for a lock to put on a regular locker. When you make an investment, factor in the cost of protecting that investment in the future. A few dollars today can save you hundreds if not thousands down the road.  JESTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Possession of Marijuana / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia / Tampering With Physical Evidence: UT Police Officers responded to a 4th floor dormitory room to investigate a report of a strong odor of burning marijuana.

One of the two subjects was found to have five outstanding outside agency arrest warrants for an animal with no current rabies vaccination (the animal being a pet, not the person), camping in a public place where prohibited, two pedestrian in the roadway offenses and one for aggressive solicitation. The other non-UT subject was found to have two outstanding outside agency arrest warrants for an animal with no current rabies vaccination (again, the animal being a pet, not the person) and for camping in a public place where prohibited. Occurred on 04/02/15 at 9:07 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 28 Alarm Reports, 3 Suspicious Activity Reports, 5 Welfare Concern Reports, 2 Medical Emergency Reports, 1 Traffic Violation, 1 Motor Vehicle Collision, 1 Found Property Report, 1 Stuck Elevator Report and 2 Public Assist Requests between 04/02/15 and 04/03/15.

Occurred on 04/09/15 at 10:22 PM.  PARKING LOT 103, 2000 Comal  Driving While Intoxicated / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia / Possession of Dangerous Drug: A UT Patrol Officer observed a white Chevrolet pick-up truck skewed in a parking space in the parking lot. The officer discovered the truck was running and occupied by a driver who was asleep at the wheel. Upon closer inspection, the officer observed a glass pipe with burned methamphetamine residue in the bowl. While standing by the vehicle, the subject roused suddenly and �jammed the accelerator.� Fortunately, the vehicle was in park so it didn�t go anywhere. When the officer asked the subject for his driver�s license, the subject pulled a twenty dollar bill out of his wallet and handed it to the officer. At one point during the field sobriety test, the subject put his hands behind his back and stated he was �used to being arrested.� The officer felt the same as the subject was found to be under the influence of an intoxicating substance to the point he was deemed to have been driving while intoxicated. Officers found a plastic bag containing .95 grams of methamphetamine inside the vehicle. Believe it or not, that was not the most interesting thing found in the vehicle � well, in the subject anyway. The subject was found to have a tooth lodged in one of his fingers, which the subject claimed was from a physical altercation he had the previous week. Austin-Travis County EMS transported the subject to a local hospital for a tooth extraction of sorts.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Friday, 04/10/15 and Monday, 04/13/15.  JESTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Public Intoxication / Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor / Possession of Fictitious Driver�s License: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, observed a uniformed officer and attempted to run from that officer. The student�s blood alcohol concentration level was probably the best reason for her failed attempt to run as she fell a short distance layer. The fall, or should I say, the impact with the ground, caused the student to require medical attention. The student showed several signs of intoxication and was found to be in possession of a fictitious driver�s license. Austin-Travis County EMS arrived and transported the student to a local hospital. No charges were filed for the public intoxication charge or the fictitious driver�s license, but the student will need to answer for the consumption violation. Occurred on 04/12/15 at 1:25 AM.  PICKLE RESEARCH CAMPUS, 10100 Burnet   Criminal Trespass / Assist Outside Agency: A non-UT subject was reported as disrobing in front of one of the buildings on the closed campus.

The subject was found to have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for failure to identify. Occurred on 04/11/15 at 3:28 AM.  SAN JACINTO RESIDENCE HALL, 309 East 21st Street  Violation of Protective Order / Criminal Trespass Warning: A UT student, who had an active protective order on file for another UT student, entered the dormitory in an attempt to make contact with the other student.

Occurred on 04/12/15 at 11:19 PM.  UNIVERSITY TOWERS, 713 West 23rd Street  Burglary of a Building: A glass window in a door located on the west side of the south building was broken out.

That being said, allow me to highlight two of the more popular scams. The first is based on a simple deception and the scam artist preying upon people�s fear of being arrested. In this scam, a person clones an area police department�s telephone number and calls the victim. The caller then states he or she is with that police department and that the victim owes money (usually back taxes) and threatens arrest if the victim does not make an immediate payment with a pre-paid debit card over the phone. The caller will actually remain on the phone while you go to a store and purchase a debit card then he or she will ask for the account number on the activated card. If you receive a call similar to this, simply tell the caller you will make contact with the entity claiming you owe money � in this example, the Internal Revenue Service � and hang up. Trust me if you owe any taxes, the IRS will be more than happy to let you know how much you owe when you call them.   Another scam seen during Tax Season involves the scammer using your personal identifying number to file a tax claim before you get a chance to do so. You typically discover this scam when your tax return submission is declined due a file already being submitted. While difficult to do, prevention is the key with this one. There are several companies out there that provide identity protection. Short of such measures, protecting your identifying information is of the utmost importance. An identity thief can procure enough identifying information to file a claim in your name from a variety of sources.  Hacking your electronic devices is one method someone can obtain your identifying information. While you may have the best fire walls, anti-virus software and passwords on planet earth, you can�t say the same for all of the businesses, doctor�s offices, academic institutions, financial entities and employers you have previously provided your personal identifying information. Whenever I have cause to provide my driver�s license number, social security number and / or my name and date of birth, I always ask how the information is stored, how it is used by the entity collecting it, who has access to that information, how long they keep the information and how they dispose of the information when they no longer need it. If I don�t like any of the answers I get back, I take my business elsewhere. But I digress, if you have fallen victim to this type of identity theft, contact the IRS, the Credit Bureau and your local police department.   JESTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Criminal Mischief: An unknown subject propelled a brick through a 1st floor exterior window to an office located on the south side of the dormitory. It did not appear as if entry was made into the office. Repair cost: $200.00. Reported on 04/14/15 at 1:10 AM.  300 West 24th Street  Criminal Mischief: A UT student reported an unknown subject applied a clear bonding agent to the ignition keyhole of his Kawasaki motorcycle while the motorcycle was parked in the motorcycle parking spaces on the north side of the Union Building. The bonding agent prevented the student from inserting the key into the ignition. Repair cost: $150.00. Reported on 04/14/15 at 2:18 AM.   2500 San Antonio  Driving While Intoxicated: A non-UT subject was observed driving a silver colored Honda at a rate much faster than other vehicles he was passing. Before being stopped, the subject was observed driving through a parking lot to avoid a red light intersection. When the officer activated the patrol car�s emergency lights to initiate a traffic stop, the subject sped off and nearly struck a pedestrian before coming to a stop in a near-by parking lot. The subject seemed �surprised� he was being stopped. That surprise faded as the officer developed probable cause to believe the subject had been driving while intoxicated. Occurred on 04/13/15 at 8:56 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 27 Alarm Reports, 4 Suspicious Activity Reports, 2 Accidental Damage Reports, 2 Welfare Concern Reports, 2 Public Assist Requests, 8 Traffic Violations, 2 Motor Vehicle Collisions and 1 Unsecured Door Report between 04/13/15 and 04/14/15.

Law enforcement and the IRS do not make such demands and will never mandate a payment be made over the phone.

The reader told me several of his neighbors had experienced auto burglaries of their cars which were parked in their driveways or the road outside of their homes. In each case there were no signs or evidence of how the burglar made entry. The reader conducted some research and found news stories of �high tech� auto burglars. These thieves can use a variety of electronic devices that either mimics the frequency of the car�s remote access FOB or boosts FOB�s signal to cause the door to unlock. Some people have opted to place their car FOBs in their freezer to block the signal while others have invested in alarm systems that do not deactivate with the unlocking of the door. These are viable options but I would encourage everyone to start by not leaving any items inside your vehicle.

Make sure you have a safety plan that should include keeping a sober friend with you when you go out. Know your limits and don�t exceed them. Know that you continue to get more intoxicated even after you stop drinking alcoholic beverages � Slow your roll! Did I mention the sober friend thing? Don�t take your car. That way you are not tempted to drive after drinking. Take a cab, take a bus � let your sober friend drive you. Keep your cell phone with you and make sure you have an emergency contact number in your contacts list under �ICE.� � Oh and don�t forget that sober friend.   For our faculty and staff members, realize there will be people all around campus this weekend and several buildings will be open for commencement activities.

Sgt. Kelley will be missed.  JESTER EAST RESIDENCE HALL, 201 East 21st Street  Theft: A new student orientation participant reported the theft of his T-Mobile wireless router.

Officers found the subject using a wall to maintain a vertical position. The subject believed he was on Red River Street and argued that belief even after a San Jacinto Blvd street sign was pointed out to him. While the subject denied having consumed any alcoholic beverages, the multitude of indicators displayed by the subject led the officer to believe the subject was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point he was a physical danger to himself and others. Occurred on 06/24/15 at 10:44 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 16 Alarm Reports, 2 Fire Alarm Activations, 5 Suspicious Activity Reports, 11 Traffic Violations, 2 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 5 Unsecured Door Reports and 1 Public Assist Requests between 06/24/15 and 06/25/15.

The Constable advised the officer he had stopped the truck after witnessing the truck driving very slowly on the shoulder of IH 35. Prior to yielding to the flashing red and blue lights of the Constable’s marked patrol unit, the driver of the truck turned into the parking lot and struck a parked and unattended vehicle. After driving a short distance from that collision, the non-UT driver of the truck stopped, rolled down a window and poured a frothy amber liquid onto the pavement. The driver of the truck plainly admitted to having been drinking a beer while driving due to “heavy traffic on the highway.” The driver showed several classic signs of intoxication and was taken into custody for driving while intoxicated. Because of the open container in the vehicle and the driver’s six prior convictions for DWI, the case should be enhanced to higher charges. Occurred on 06/25/15 at 1:10 PM.   PETER T. FLAWN ACADEMIC CENTER, 2304 Whitis  Theft: A white Diamond Back bicycle was stolen while it was secured with a cable lock to the bicycle racks located on the east side of the building.

The driver showed signs of intoxication which led to the administration of field sobriety testing.

Wanting to confirm his suspicions, the officer encouraged the completion of the tests. In the end, the officer agreed with the driver’s self-assessment. An open and mostly consumed bottle of Tequila was found on the front driver’s side floorboard. Occurred on 06/26/15 at 3:23 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 21 Alarm Reports, 7 Suspicious Activity Reports, 9 Traffic Violations, 4 Unsecured Door Reports, 1 Malfunctioning Light Report, 1 Medical Emergency Assist, 2 Welfare Concern Reports and 6 Public Assist Requests between 06/25/15 and 06/26/15.

Occurred on 06/26/15 at approximately 8:50 AM.   2100 Guadalupe  Assault by Contact / Disorderly Conduct – Uses Abusive or Profane Language: A UT faculty member reported seeing a verbal disturbance between two subjects near a bus stop. When the faculty member went to pass the subjects, one of the subjects asked her for money.

Occurred on 06/26/15 at approximately 7:30 AM.  2400 Guadalupe  Public Intoxication: Two non-UT subjects were observed knelling beside the roadway.

Occurred on 06/26/15 at 2:18 PM.  2900 Guadalupe  Possession of Marijuana / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A non-UT subject was stopped for driving at a rate faster then allowed by posted sign.

When responding officers arrived, the subject stated he used to callbox to obtain information regarding enrollment at UT. A records check showed the subject had been issued a prior written criminal trespass warning when he used the same callbox a month earlier to place a drink order. Occurred on 06/30/15 at 3:42 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: The “Police Help” callboxes are placed all around campus to provide 9-1-1 phone services to the UT Police Dispatcher. While they can be used to summon a variety police services and assistance, they should not be used to inquire about enrollment at UT…they certainly shouldn’t be used to place a drink order.   L. THEO BELMONT HALL, 2109 San Jacinto  Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject was reported as loitering inside a 3rd floor office while listening to “loud music.” When stopped, the subject made several claims of being affiliated with the athletic department; none of which could be verified.

The fact the subject was lying down in the intersection was not the only thing that caught the attention of the officer. The fact the subject was clad only in his underpants really tipped the officer off that something was awry. Prior to making contact with the subject, a UT student dashed into the intersection to help his friend out of the roadway. The underdressed subject showed several signs of being under the influence of a mind altering substance. When questioned, the student leaned in and whispered to the officer that his friend had ingested LSD – as if that fact was a secret. During the interview, the non-UT subject approached the officer and reached for the officer’s holstered sidearm – that’s a big no-no. When identified, it was discovered that both the non-UT subject and the UT student were under the age of 21 and in possession of fictitious driver’s licenses which purported them to be older than 21. The non-UT subject was found to be under the influence to the point Austin-Travis County EMS needed to transport him to a local hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Responding officers located the slumbering subject and noted he was very popular with the local flies.

Reported on 07/15/15 at 2:57 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: There are a few tips I would offer here. First and foremost, never leave your property unattended – I know that is a given but most thefts happen when an item is left unattended. The next tip I offer is to be in the habit of using strong passwords to lock your electronics. By doing this, you make it more difficult for a thief to access your personal and financial data on your cellphones, tablets, laptops, game systems, desktop computers, scanners, fax machines, microwave ovens…etc. A strong password should include alpha-numeric characters, lower case and upper case characters and special characters. Refrain from using predictable words, phrases or number series in your password. Finally, if your property is stolen, report the theft to the police department as soon as possible. By reporting the property as stolen, you give the police an opportunity to locate the property – if you don’t report your property as stolen, then the police don’t even know to look for it. Also, most police officers will provide you with tips to protect future crimes. In this case, an officer may have directed the victim to cancel his Amazon account on 06/23/15 which may have prevented the credit card abuse case that happened on 07/15/15.  LIVING LEARNING CENTER, 2610 Whitis  Graffiti: White paint was used to write illegible words on an exterior stairway handrail located on the west side of the building.

That being said, I would like to make one more suggestions. If you park in a parking garage, do not leave the access card or pull ticket in the vehicle when you park. If a vehicle thief doesn’t possess the access card or pull ticket, he or she would need to force their way out of the garage or summon assistance from garage staff to exit the garage; either way, they would be less likely to want to steal your vehicle.   SAN JACINTO PARKING GARAGE, 2401 San Jacinto  Duty Upon Striking Unattended Vehicle: A UT student reported the left rear bumper of her green Toyota Highlander was struck while the vehicle was parked on the 3rd level of the garage.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Wednesday, 09/02/15 and Thursday, 09/03/15.  ****Administrative Messages****  Recently, the University of Texas Police Department has received several calls from concerned citizens about people recklessly riding bicycles on campus. We have heard of people disregarding stop signs, weaving in and out of traffic on the roads and doing the same around pedestrians on the sidewalk…not to mention speeding while atop their self-propelled cycles. These calls are borne out of concern for public safety and for good reason. Just yesterday, The UT Police Department responded to a collision between two bicyclists on 21st Street near the PCL Library. In that collision, both cyclists sustained injuries. While we are all responsible for the safe passage across campus, we do want to remind bicyclists in particular that you should treat your bike ride as a trip in your car. You need to maintain the posted speed limit, stop at stop signs, yield to pedestrians and only use hands-free communication devices. To help bicyclists remember these rules of the road, The UT Police Department will be out at 24th Street and Speedway and 21st Street and Speedway to encourage voluntary compliance with the Traffic Law.  Citizen’s Police Academy Announcement  Every year, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department provides our UT Family the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of our department during a Citizen’s Police Academy (CPA). Our next CPA is rapidly approaching.

When awakened, the subject showed several signs of intoxication including an inability to control certain bodily functions. The subject stated he had a “small drink” at 4:00 AM. That small drink must have packed a power punch as the subject was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point he was a danger to himself and others. Occurred on 09/02/15 at 7:18 AM.  2300 Guadalupe (non-UT Property)  Assault by Threat: A UT student telephoned the UT Police Department to report she had been threatened earlier in the day. The student reported an unknown subject had asked her for food after the student parked along the roadway.

RAD is a program of realistic, self-defense tactics and techniques. It is a comprehensive course for women. The course begins with awareness, prevention, risk reduction and avoidance then progresses on to the basics of hands-on defense training. Please visit The University of Texas at Austin Police Department webpage to register – www.utexas.edu/police   JESTER WEST DORMITORY, 201 East 21st Street  Possession of Alcohol by a Minor: Police Officers were summoned to a 3rd floor dormitory room where the distinct odor of burning THC loomed heavily. After knocking on the dormitory room door, an occupant asked who was knocking. A mere two minutes after the police announced their presence, the resident opened the door. The resident, who was under the age of 21, stated he had previously inhaled “a lot of marijuana.” The resident stated the delay in opening the door was attributed to him taking the time to hide the vodka bottle he was drinking out of. The resident then produced an open bottle of vodka from his backpack. While there was plenty of olfactory evidence to suggest marijuana had recently been burned inside the room, there was no remaining physical evidence in plain sight. Occurred on 09/04/15 at 1:04 AM.   UNIVERSITY TEACHING CENTER, 105 West 21st Street  Theft: A UT student entered a 3rd floor women’s restroom and hung a cloth bag containing school documents and a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes on a wall hook. When the student went to retrieve the bag she discovered it had been stolen. Loss value: $600.00. Occurred on 09/03/15 between 12:20 PM and 12:35 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: This was no doubt a crime of opportunity. Leaving your property on a hook outside of a public restroom stall places that property at risk for theft. Most thieves know that the owner of the property is not likely to jump up and chase after them – even if they know the property was being stolen. Anytime you use a public restroom, bring your property into the stall with you.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 27 Alarm Reports, 1 Fire Alarm Activation, 22 Traffic violations, 7 Suspicious Activity Reports, 5 Medical Emergency Assist Requests, 3 Found Property Reports, 2 Malfunctioning Light Reports and 4 Public Assist Requests between 09/03/15 and 09/04/15.

Today, I would like to address the many pedestrians on campus. You play a significant role in the safe and efficient passage of everyone on campus. To start with, be an active pedestrian. Turn your attention away from your cell phone and to the happenings around you. Pay attention to the potential hazards around you while you walk. Those hazards could include vehicles approaching as you step out into traffic. While pedestrians have the right-of-way, it is incumbent upon the pedestrian to make sure bicyclists and vehicle drivers see you and yield to you before you step in front of them. By paying attention to the on-goings around you, a mugger is less likely to select you as victim.  Looking around campus it is easy to believe most pedestrians do not believe traffic laws apply to them. This just simply is not the case. There are several traffic laws that apply to pedestrians. Most of those laws pertain to pedestrians being in the roadway. Crossing the roadway where there is no designated crosswalk comes to mind here. Another concern we hear about is pedestrians crossing at red-light intersections against the crossing signal. Many of the intersections along Dean Keeton Street have specific times when pedestrians are allowed to cross. Sadly, many pedestrians also cross the intersection when vehicular traffic has a greenlight. This prevents vehicular traffic from making turns at intersections or worse, places cars and pedestrians in the crosswalk at the same time.  We all share the responsibility for safe passage on campus.   ALMETRIS DUREN HALL, 2624 Whitis  Theft: A blue Mongoose bicycle was stolen while it was secured with two cable locks to the bicycle racks located on the northeast side of the building. Loss value: $100.00. Occurred between 09/04/15 at 11:59 PM and 09/09/15 at 9:30 PM. Crime Prevention Tip:  The UT Police Department has recommended the use of two DIFFERENT types of locks for bicycle security for years. It is important to note in this case that two locks were used, but they were both cable locks. The thief only needed one tool to defeat each lock. That tool was more than likely a cutting device like wire cutters or bolt cutters. If a cable lock and a u-lock were used to secure the bicycle then the thief would need a cutting tool and a prying tool. Most thieves don’t carry both of these types of tools with them.   ERNEST COCKRELL Jr, 301 East Dean Keeton  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was reported as loitering inside the building. The subject was known by the reporting person as someone who had previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning. The subject was located inside a 3rd floor room where it was confirmed had had been issued said warning. The subject was subsequently taken into custody. Occurred on 09/10/15 at 8:30 AM.  GREGORY GYMNASIUM, 2101 Speedway  Theft: $300 in cash was stolen from a wallet that was left on a bench inside the ground level weight room while the owner did squats nearby. Occurred on 09/10/15 between 10:15 PM and 10:40 PM.  STUDENT SERVICES BUILDING, 100 West Dean Keeton  Theft: An Apple iPhone 5 was stolen from an unsecured 4th floor office. Loss value: $200.00. Occurred between 09/09/15 at 6:00 PM and 09/10/15 at 7:30 AM.  UNION BUILDING, 2308 Whitis  Criminal Trespass Warning (2 counts): Two non-UT subjects were found sleeping on the south side of the building. Both subjects received a wake-up call in the form of written criminal trespass warnings. Occurred on 09/10/15 at 7:45 AM.  200 West 24th Street  Criminal Mischief: The right rear window of a black Nissan Pathfinder was broken while the vehicle was legally parked and unattended. No items inside the vehicle were disturbed or missing. Repair cost: $200.00. Occurred non 09/10/15 between 7:20 AM and 1:00 PM.  2200 Guadalupe  Assist Outside Agency: A non-UT subject was found lying on the sidewalk. The subject learned that if you have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for a parole violation, then you probably shouldn’t block a public sidewalk by lying down. Occurred on 09/10/15 at 7:30 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 30 Alarm Reports, 16 Traffic Violations, 10 Suspicious Activity Reports, 7 Medical Emergency Assist Requests, 2 Found Property Reports, 1 Malfunctioning Light Report, 1 Unsecured Door Report, 1 Stuck Elevator Report and 6 Public Assist Requests between 09/10/15 and 09/11/15.

The student brought his passed out friend to a 3rd floor restroom and then conducted an on-line search for the symptoms of alcohol poisoning. The student felt it was best to call 9-1-1 for his friend. Austin-Travis County EMS concurred with the student’s assessment and transported the passed out student to a local hospital for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. No charges will be filed under the medical amnesty act. Occurred on 09/13/15 at 4:19 AM.   BRAZOS PARKING GARAGE, 210 East Martin Luther King  Disorderly Conduct (Offensive Gesture): A UT student reported an unidentified person extended a specific phalange in her direction after she honked at him for driving his black Dodge Charger the wrong way on a one-way roadway.

Occurred on 09/11/15 at 3:30 PM.  COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS, 305 East 23rd Street  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject as reported as being “passed out” on the exterior stairs located on the north side of the building. The subject was awakened and found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point Austin-Travis County EMS needed to transport the subject to a local hospital for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. Occurred on 09/15/15 at 1:19 AM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Public Intoxication: A UT student attempted to enter the stadium while in possession of a blue backpack that contained an open bottle of alcohol. When denied entry, his description, that included his Ninja Turtle t-shirt, was distributed to the other entry gates. When an officer stopped the student at another entry point, the subject consented to a check of his backpack where the open bottle of alcohol still resided. When denied entry again, the student began to yell threatening and offensive words at the patrons in the line. The student was found to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage to the point he was deemed to be a danger to himself and others. Occurred on 09/12/15 at 8:38 AM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Public Intoxication / Assist Outside Agency: A non-UT subject stumbled into a first aid station on the north side of the stadium. While the subject was not able to stand well on his own, EMS advised the subject did not require medical treatment. After the arrival of police officers, the subject began to flirt and wink at the female first responders. The subject’s flirtatious nature diminished once he was deemed to be intoxicated to the point he was a danger to himself. The subject was also found to have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for speeding in a school zone. Occurred on 09/12/15 at 8:56 PM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Public Intoxication / Resisting Arrest / Possession of Fictitious Driver’s License: A patron reported an intoxicated subject in section 28. The responding officer located the subject, a UT student in the 73rd row of the section. While the student denied having consumed alcoholic beverages, the officer could detect an odor of metabolized alcohol on the student’s breath; he did not feel the student was a danger to himself at that time. Sometime later, the officer observed the same student stumbling down the stairs and bumping into other patrons. The officer went to affect an arrest for public intoxication. The student disagreed with the officer’s assessment and resisted to the point he attempted to fight with the officer. Once taken into custody, the student was also found to be in possession of a fictitious driver’s license. Occurred on 09/12/15 at 7:38 PM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was reported to have fallen on a bus stop bench. The responding officer arrived in time to see the subject using a light pole to defeat his battle with gravity. The subject was unaware of his injuries to his lips or knee and stated he had consumed 8 beers at 10:30 PM. The subject either had a really difficult time metabolizing the previous night’s beer consumption or he had a time machine as the time of the stop was 9:32 PM. The subject was found to be intoxicated to the point he was a danger to himself and benches everywhere. Occurred on 09/12/15 at 9:32 PM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was observed stumbling down a flight of stairs leading to Gate 1 of the stadium.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Thursday, 10/01/15 and Friday, 10/02/15.  Yesterday, a tragic shooting incident occurred at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon. While our thoughts and prayers go out to that college community and all of those impacted by this senseless act, we want to remind the Longhorn Family of the resources available on the 40 Acres. Several years ago, UT developed the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL). This program is simply a phone number anyone can call anytime they develop concerns about something they heard or observed but don’t know just what to do with that concern. By calling BCAL at 512-232-5050 you will speak with a trained professional who will hear your concern and route that concern to the appropriate UT Office to provide assistance to someone who may need it. We would also like to encourage every Longhorn to visit the UT Police Department webpage to view a twenty minute video that covers action options to consider in the event an active shooter incident happens on campus. This video and other videos can be viewed at: http://www.utexas.edu/police/videos/   Safety Week 2015  Next week, The UT Student Government, UT Housing and Food and UT Police Department will be partnering to bring Safety Week to the campus.

Occurred on 10/01/15 between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM.  WEST MALL, 2300 Guadalupe  Criminal Trespass (2 counts) / Resisting Arrest: During a scheduled public rally on the west steps of the Main Building, a non-UT subject, who was in opposition of the rally sponsors, occupied the steps and held signage in opposition of the rally sponsors. The subject refused to move off of the steps after being directed to do so multiple times by the UT Dean of Students Office. A UT police officer then stepped in and directed the subject to leave or be charged with criminal trespass. The subject again refused and was arrested. Shortly thereafter, a second non-UT subject occupied the reserved area of the scheduled rally. That subject also refused to leave after being directed to do so several times. When police officers initiated an arrest of that subject, he resisted the arrest and was subsequently charged with resisting arrest. Occurred on 10/01/15 at 12:05 PM.   300 East 24th Street  Public Intoxication / Possession of Fictitious Driver’s License: A cab driver flagged down a UT Police Officer to report an intoxicated fare who wanted to go to the 600 block of East 24th Street. The non-UT subject, who was under the age of 21, was found to have a wet spot on the front of his britches in an area that limited the possible causes down to just one or two options. That subject showed several other signs of intoxication including a belief that Mickey Mouse was a cat. That subject went on to state he had consumed 29 beers earlier in the evening. Of course the officers didn’t put too much faith in his general understanding of numbers and math as he also thought there were 1999 dimes in a dollar. When asked for identification, the subject presented a fictitious driver’s license with a date of birth making the subject older than 21. The subject was found to be under the influence of alcohol to the point he was deemed to be a danger to himself and others. Occurred on 10/02/15 at 1:46 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 27 Alarm Reports, 17 Traffic Violations, 2 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 11 Suspicious Activity Reports, 2 Welfare Concern Reports, 1 Medical Emergency Assist Request, 1 Stuck Elevator Report and 5 Public Assist Requests between 10/01/15 and 10/02/15.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Friday, 10/02/15 and Monday 10/05/15.  Safety Week 2015  This week, The UT Student Government, UT Housing and Food and UT Police Department is partnering to bring Safety Week to the campus. During the week, there will be different focus topics starting with fire safety and emergency preparedness on Monday. For more information on the week’s events, visit: https://www.facebook.com/events/158707654474734/ and https://www.facebook.com/events/554170081403183/ CHEMICAL PETROLEUM ENGINEERING, 200 East Dean Keeton  Theft: A silver colored Gary Fisher “hard tail” bicycle was stolen while it was secured with a chain lock to the bicycle racks located outside of the building. Loss value: $200.00. Occurred between 09/30/15 at 1:00 PM and 10/01/15 at 9:00 AM.  JESTER ACADEMIC, 201 East 21st Street  Public Intoxication: A UT student, who was under the age of 21, was reported as being “passed out” on a table in a 1st floor restaurant. When awakened, the student showed signs of intoxication and admitted to having consumed beverages that lead to intoxication while on 6th Street. In lieu of arrest, the student was turned over to a sober, responsible adult who agreed to take care, custody and control of him. Occurred on 10/03/15 at 2:33 AM.   LITTLEFIELD RESIDENCE HALL, 201 West Dean Keeton  Theft / Assist Outside Agency / Criminal Trespass / Possession of Marijuana: The rear wheel and frame of a red colored Trek bicycle were stolen while the front wheel was secured with a u-lock to the bicycle racks located on the south side of the residence hall. A short time later, a patrolling Sergeant located a non-UT subject sleeping on the west side of Walter Webb Hall. It just so happened, that subject was sleeping next to a bicycle that matched a description of the stolen bicycle. Upon waking the subject, he claimed ownership of the bicycle. A bicycle registration revealed the bicycle did not belong to the subject but was in fact the one that was reported stolen. IN addition to having previously been issued a written criminal trespass warning, the subject was found to have five, count them, five, outstanding outside agency arrest warrants for an open container violation, solicitation, alcohol in a prohibited area, pedestrian crossing against the light and camping in a public area. As if things weren’t bad enough for this subject, he was also found to be in possession of .11 ounces of marijuana. Loss value: $700.00. Occurred between 10/02/15 at 4:00 PM and 10/02/15 at 9:00 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Using a u-lock is just one part of the solution to prevent bike thefts. You must lock the bicycle properly to the bike rack. Make sure you secured the frame and front wheel to the bike rack with the u-lock. In this case, the thief probably stole a front wheel form another near-by bike and rode off leaving two victims behind.  Regardless of the type of lock or manner in which you secure your bicycle, make sure you register the bike with UT Parking and Transportation Services. This is required of anyone with a bike on campus. It is free and can be done on-line. More importantly, it helps in the identification of stolen bicycles as it did in this case.   SAN ANTONIO PARKING GARAGE, 2420 San Antonio  Criminal Mischief: The entry control arm on the southwest side of the parking garage was broken from the control box. Repair cost: $200.00. Discovered on 10/04/15 at 11:42 AM.  SPEEDWAY PARKING GARAGE, 105 East 27th Street  Criminal Mischief: The exit control arm on the east side of the parking garage was broken from the control box. Repair cost: $200.00. Discovered on 10/03/15 at 7:50 AM.  The Campus  Criminal Mischief: A Patrolling Officer discovered an unknown subject or subjects had placed traffic cones atop the statues located around the campus. Removal cost: $50.00. Discovered on 10/04/15 at 4:08 AM.  Trinity and Martin Luther King  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was reported as “yelling” in the middle of the intersection. The subject was located but whomever she was yelling at was nowhere to be found. It is believed she may have been trying to hail a cab. When asked how much she had to drink, she stated she had “a few.” Apparently she had a few too many as she was deemed to be a danger to herself and passing motorists. In lieu of arrest, she was turned over to a friend who was summoned to the scene. Occurred on 10/02/15 at 8:33 PM.  2600 Guadalupe  Possession of Marijuana: A non-UT subject was observed driving left of the center line of the roadway. After being stopped, the officer could detect the all too familiar odor of THC. When asked about the odor, the subject told the officer he had some marijuana in his ash tray. When told the vehicle would be searched, the all too agreeable subject opened the trunk of the vehicle and produced two baggies containing a total of 1.65 ounces of marijuana. Occurred on 10/03/15 at 12:06 PM.  2500 San Antonio  Assist Outside Agency: A non-UT subject as stopped for driving the wrong way on a one-way roadway. The subject was found to have an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for criminal trespass. Occurred on 10/04/15 at 9:12 PM.  2500 University  Possession of Dangerous Drug: Officers responded to a report of a subject lying on the ground. Officers found the subject who later stated he became ill after smoking what he thought was marijuana. The subject handed the officers a hand rolled cigar containing .05 ounces of the synthetic cannabinoid frequently called K2. The subject was checked by Austin-Travis County EMS who deemed the attention he needed was not medical attention. Occurred on 10/03/15 at 2:56 PM.  26th Street and Nueces  Public Intoxication: Pedestrians flagged own an officer and directed that officer to a passed out subject near the intersection. The subject, who was an under-aged UT student, was found passed out while in a seated position on the curb. When awakened, the subject was unclear about his name and where he had over-consumed the ETOH. It was either at the ACL fest or a multi-resident house of people with similar mindsets and tastes in clothing. The student was intoxicated to the point Austin-Travis County EMS needed to transport the student to a local hospital for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. Occurred on 10/03/15 at 1:38 AM.  8th Street and Trinity  Assault: A cab driver contacted the UT Police Department to report an incident that occurred at 8th and Trinity Street. The cab driver stated five subjects requested a ride from that location to the AT&T Executive Education & Conference Center and proceeded to pour into his cab. When the cab driver told the group he could only take four riders, one of the subjects grabbed his shirt and tore it, another subject slapped him across his face and a third subject spat on him. The cab driver left the area. Recalling the subjects wanted to go to the AT&T Executive Education & Conference Center, the cab driver went to that location and called 9-1-1. The four subjects were not located. Occurred on 10/04/15 at approximately 1:02 AM.  300 West 24th Street  Assist Outside Agency / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A non-UT subject honked at a passing patrol vehicle to summon assistance. The officer looked at the subject’s car and observed another, non-UT subject, was standing by the closed driver’s window of the car. The officer separated the standing subject from the car and learned both parties had recently ended their relationship. The two subjects began to argue while the first was providing a ride for the second to a bus stop. The first subject pulled over to let the second subject out of her vehicle. The second subject did not want to end the relationship and was arguing his point through the closed window. Officers discovered the second subject had an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for speeding on a state highway. The officers also found the second subject was in possession of a glass pipe containing burned marijuana residue. I am not sure of the future of their relationship, but for now, the two are separated. Occurred on 10/03/15 at 6:06 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 72 Alarm Reports, 3 “Police Help” Callbox Activations, 17 Traffic Violations, 2 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 16 Suspicious Activity Reports, 9 Welfare Concern Reports, 4 Medical Emergency Assist Requests, 3 Malfunctioning Lights, 3 Found Property Reports and 17 Public Assist Requests between 10/02/15 and 10/05/15.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Monday 10/05/15 and Tuesday, 10/06/15.  UT Austin Safety Alert  UTPD has received numerous inquiries this evening regarding an anonymous Web post threatening students in the Austin area. Screen shots of this post have been circulating in social media and many in our community have appropriately brought it to UTPD’s attention. UTPD, APD, and others are investigating, but at this time there is no reason to believe this is a credible threat to our campus. We understand that this kind of threat, even a non-credible threat can create anxiety in our community. Please be assured that we would notify campus immediately if there were cause for concern. However unlikely, it is always better to be prepared. UTPD has several videos (http://www.utexas.edu/police/videos/) posted on its website that provides instruction on what to do in an active shooter situation. We encourage you to view these videos and to continue to report any unusual activity.   Safety Week 2015  This week, The UT Student Government, UT Housing and Food and UT Police Department is partnering to bring Safety Week to the campus. During the week, there will be different focus topics each day. Yesterday, students learned all about fire safety and emergency preparedness. Today, the focus is on National Night Out (NNO). Come to the Gregory Gym Plaza between 12 noon and 4 PM for a Texas sized tailgate party and enjoy free food and games while meeting your UT Police Officers. There will be a live demonstration of a DWI collision at 1:50 PM. There will be information tables of all sorts and flu shots inside Gregory Gymnasium. Don’t forget about tonight, UTPD and Housing and Food will have two events. The first will be a neighborhood party at the Gateway Apartment Complex where UTPD Officers will participate in a panel discussion while residents enjoy free food and activities. On the main campus, UT Police Officers will join Housing and food at a carnival themed block party on the San Jacinto Residence Hall Plaza. Both of these parties will be from 6 PM to 8 PM. For more information on the week’s events, visit: https://www.facebook.com/events/158707654474734/ and https://www.facebook.com/events/554170081403183/ JESTER EAST, 201 East 21st Street  Criminal Mischief: A ceiling tile and an emergency exit sign were knocked from the ceiling in a 3rd floor hallway. The ceiling tile and exit sign were damaged beyond repair. Loss value: $70.00. Occurred on 10/02/15 between 1:50 AM and 2:20 AM.  ROBERT A. WELCH HALL, 105 East 24th Street  Theft: A UT student accidentally left his wallet inside a 2nd floor classroom after taking a test. The student returned to the classroom several hours later and discovered his wallet was missing. The wallet was later turned into the lost and found office. When the student claimed his wallet he discovered $28.00 in cash had been stolen from the wallet. Occurred on 10/02/15 between 12:40 PM and 4:30 PM.   1900 East Manor Road  Public Intoxication: Yours truly observed a non-UT subject making every attempt to remain upright and not fall into the roadway. The subject bobbled, swayed, stammered and stumbled as he walked eastbound then west bound, then east bound and again west bound beside the road. When stopped, the subject could not recall much of the previous night and had a cut above his right eye. The subject stated he received the cut after walking into a utility pole. Austin-Travis County EMS responded and assessed the subject. Against their advice, he refused medical treatment. The subject was not able to refuse my advice as I believed he was under the influence of an unknown substance to the point he was a physical endangerment to himself. Occurred on 10/05/15 at 7:40 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 27 Alarm Reports, 19 Traffic Violations, 9 Suspicious Activity Reports, 9 Welfare Concern Reports, 1 Medical Emergency Assist Request, 4 Unsecured Door Reports and 6 Public Assist Requests between 10/05/15 and 10/06/15.

Occurred on 10/04/15 at approximately 1:02 AM.  300 West 24th Street  Assist Outside Agency / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A non-UT subject honked at a passing patrol vehicle to summon assistance. The officer looked at the subject’s car and observed another, non-UT subject, was standing by the closed driver’s window of the car. The officer separated the standing subject from the car and learned both parties had recently ended their relationship. The two subjects began to argue while the first was providing a ride for the second to a bus stop. The first subject pulled over to let the second subject out of her vehicle. The second subject did not want to end the relationship and was arguing his point through the closed window. Officers discovered the second subject had an outstanding outside agency arrest warrant for speeding on a state highway. The officers also found the second subject was in possession of a glass pipe containing burned marijuana residue. I am not sure of the future of their relationship, but for now, the two are separated. Occurred on 10/03/15 at 6:06 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 72 Alarm Reports, 3 “Police Help” Callbox Activations, 17 Traffic Violations, 2 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 16 Suspicious Activity Reports, 9 Welfare Concern Reports, 4 Medical Emergency Assist Requests, 3 Malfunctioning Lights, 3 Found Property Reports and 17 Public Assist Requests between 10/02/15 and 10/05/15.  Prepared by: Ofc.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Monday 10/05/15 and Tuesday, 10/06/15.  UT Austin Safety Alert  UTPD has received numerous inquiries this evening regarding an anonymous Web post threatening students in the Austin area. Screen shots of this post have been circulating in social media and many in our community have appropriately brought it to UTPD’s attention. UTPD, APD, and others are investigating, but at this time there is no reason to believe this is a credible threat to our campus. We understand that this kind of threat, even a non-credible threat can create anxiety in our community. Please be assured that we would notify campus immediately if there were cause for concern. However unlikely, it is always better to be prepared. UTPD has several videos (http://www.utexas.edu/police/videos/) posted on its website that provides instruction on what to do in an active shooter situation. We encourage you to view these videos and to continue to report any unusual activity.   Safety Week 2015  This week, The UT Student Government, UT Housing and Food and UT Police Department is partnering to bring Safety Week to the campus. During the week, there will be different focus topics each day. Yesterday, students learned all about fire safety and emergency preparedness. Today, the focus is on National Night Out (NNO). Come to the Gregory Gym Plaza between 12 noon and 4 PM for a Texas sized tailgate party and enjoy free food and games while meeting your UT Police Officers. There will be a live demonstration of a DWI collision at 1:50 PM. There will be information tables of all sorts and flu shots inside Gregory Gymnasium. Don’t forget about tonight, UTPD and Housing and Food will have two events. The first will be a neighborhood party at the Gateway Apartment Complex where UTPD Officers will participate in a panel discussion while residents enjoy free food and activities. On the main campus, UT Police Officers will join Housing and food at a carnival themed block party on the San Jacinto Residence Hall Plaza. Both of these parties will be from 6 PM to 8 PM. For more information on the week’s events, visit: https://www.facebook.com/events/158707654474734/ and https://www.facebook.com/events/554170081403183/ JESTER EAST, 201 East 21st Street  Criminal Mischief: A ceiling tile and an emergency exit sign were knocked from the ceiling in a 3rd floor hallway. The ceiling tile and exit sign were damaged beyond repair. Loss value: $70.00. Occurred on 10/02/15 between 1:50 AM and 2:20 AM.  ROBERT A. WELCH HALL, 105 East 24th Street  Theft: A UT student accidentally left his wallet inside a 2nd floor classroom after taking a test. The student returned to the classroom several hours later and discovered his wallet was missing. The wallet was later turned into the lost and found office. When the student claimed his wallet he discovered $28.00 in cash had been stolen from the wallet. Occurred on 10/02/15 between 12:40 PM and 4:30 PM.   1900 East Manor Road  Public Intoxication: Yours truly observed a non-UT subject making every attempt to remain upright and not fall into the roadway. The subject bobbled, swayed, stammered and stumbled as he walked eastbound then west bound, then east bound and again west bound beside the road. When stopped, the subject could not recall much of the previous night and had a cut above his right eye. The subject stated he received the cut after walking into a utility pole. Austin-Travis County EMS responded and assessed the subject. Against their advice, he refused medical treatment. The subject was not able to refuse my advice as I believed he was under the influence of an unknown substance to the point he was a physical endangerment to himself. Occurred on 10/05/15 at 7:40 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 27 Alarm Reports, 19 Traffic Violations, 9 Suspicious Activity Reports, 9 Welfare Concern Reports, 1 Medical Emergency Assist Request, 4 Unsecured Door Reports and 6 Public Assist Requests between 10/05/15 and 10/06/15.

Today is all about Transportation Safety. Come out to the Speedway Pedestrian Plaza between 11 AM and 2 PM to meet with representatives from Capital Metro, UT Parking & Transportation Services, the UT Police Department and other groups to better learn how to safely navigate this great city we call Austin. For more information on the week’s events, visit: https://www.facebook.com/events/158707654474734/ and https://www.facebook.com/events/554170081403183/  CHEMICAL PETROLEUM ENGINEERING, 200 East Dean Keeton  Theft: A bright blue and green colored Cannondale bicycle was stolen while it was secured with a chain lock to the bicycle racks located on the west side of the building.

Loss value: $102.00. Occurred on 10/06/15 between 1:35 PM and 1:40 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: Now folks, I would like to be able to say just run faster so your stuff won’t get stolen but sadly nobody runs that fast. It only takes a few seconds of inattention for a thief to steal your property. Consider wearing your backpack during your run – that will give you a little better workout with the added weight. If you are looking to get your best time then use a locker to secure your property while you run.   PICKLE RESEARCH CAMPUS, 10100 Burnet  Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject was found sleeping in the bushes along the north fence line of the campus. The subject was awakened with the issuance of a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 10/07/15 at 1:20 AM.   WALTER WEBB HALL, 2500 Guadalupe  Criminal Trespass Warning: A non-UT subject was found sleeping on the east side of the building. The subject was awakened with the issuance of a written criminal trespass warning. Occurred on 10/06/15 at 7:41 AM.  408 West 23rd Street (non-UT Property)  Possession of Dangerous Drug / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: Officers responded to a report from a store employee on Guadalupe Street of a subject who was randomly yelling at pedestrians. While looking for that subject, UTPD Bike Officers found a group of subject who appeared to be engaged in suspicious activity. Upon seeing the officers, one of the subjects in the group quickly turned his back towards the officers and shoved something down his front pocket before walking away. The officers stopped the subject and learned the item he placed in his pocket was a pipe with burned residue. The subject stated he forgot he had that item. A short time later, two baggies fell down the leg of the shorts the subject was wearing and landed on the ground. The baggies contained a total of .16 ounces of the synthetic cannabinoid commonly referred to as K2. I guess the subject forgot he had that too. Occurred on 10/06/15 at 1:56 PM.

These folks are great and they have more cyber security tips than you can imagine.  For more information on the week’s events, visit: https://www.facebook.com/events/158707654474734/ and https://www.facebook.com/events/554170081403183/  CLARK FIELD, 307 East 21st Street  Theft: A blue Patagonia backpack containing a Lenovo laptop computer, and a Fossil (brand not indication of age) wallet with three credit cards, various forms of identification and $5 in cash was stolen after it was left unattended near the lockers on the northwest side of the fields.

Loss value: $1,100.00. Occurred on 10/07/15 between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM.  DARRELL K ROYAL TEXAS MEMORIAL STADIUM, 2200 Robert Dedman  Theft: A black leather Fossil (again, brand name not age description) purse was stolen when it was left in the bleachers during the last home football game as the owner went to the concession stands. At the time of the theft, the purse contained a Texas Driver’s License, a debit card and a bottle of prescription pills. Loss value: $110.00. Reported on 10/07/15 at 12:54 PM.  HARRY RANSOM CENTER, 300 West 21st Street  Graffiti: Silver paint was used to draw two images on a rock retaining wall located on the south side of the building. Removal cost: $75.00. Reported on 10/07/15 at 9:55 AM.  PARKING LOT 39, 2300 Red River  Criminal Mischief: A UT student reported the cable lock to his bicycle was cut while the bicycle remained secured to the bicycle racks located on the west side of the parking lot with a u-lock. Loss value: $20.00. Occurred on 10/07/15 between 8:55 AM and 5:05 PM.  UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Fraud: A UT student came into the police department to report being a victim of a fraud. The student stated she had received a phone call from someone with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The caller advised the student she had an active arrest warrant for failing to pay “student aide taxes.” The caller told the student if she failed to make payment in the next 35 minutes the UT Police would go to her location and arrest her. The student tried to negotiate a payment plan but the caller demanded more money and settled on $1,000.00 to place a “hold” on the warrant. The caller then demanded the student retrieve the money from her bank, go to a local convenience store and purchase pre-paid cash cards. The caller then demanded the student provide him the identifying numbers on the card. The student complied out of fear from being arrested. While the student was making the report, the caller called her again and stated they had problems with one of the cards and demanded she provide the numbers again. The officer directed the student to provide false number for the second card before disconnecting the phone call. Reported on 10/07/15 at 12:11 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: This is a popular scam that has been seen across the United States. The thief plays upon your fear of being arrested. Trust me, law enforcement agencies do not mandate payment over the phone with a pre-paid cash card. To stop these thieves in their tracks, we need to get the word out so students recognize this as a scam. That being said, please forward this entry to your friends, family and contacts. If you are responsible for message boards on campus, please print this entry on your boards. If you manage a list serve for your campus department, please forward this information on to your group. The more people who know about this scam, the harder it would be for the thief to be successful.   WALTER WEBB HALL, 405 West 25th Street  Graffiti: A silver colored paint pen was used to write letters on the southeast side of the building. Removal cost: $50.00. Discovered on 10/07/15 at 12:42 PM.  2300 Guadalupe (Off Campus Property)  Criminal Mischief / Aggravated Assault with Deadly Weapon / Possession of Dangerous Drugs / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A UT Police Officer was flagged down by someone wishing to report being punched in the face. The reporting person stated he confronted several people in the alley just west of Guadalupe Street about a damaged sign belonging to the business the person worked for. One person then displayed a knife toward the victim and punched the victim in the face. The suspect told the victim to “get off his property.” The victim fled the area and located the patrolling police officer. The officer quickly located the suspect and took him into custody. The suspect was then found to be in possession of .21 ounces of a synthetic cannabinoid and several pipes. Occurred on 10/07/15 at 11:21 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 33 Alarm Reports, 1 “Police Help” Callbox Activation, 2 Fire Alarm Activations, 11 Traffic Violations, 1 Motor Vehicle Collision, 7 Suspicious Activity Reports, 3 Medical Emergency Assists, 2 Welfare Concern Reports, 1 Unsecured Door Report, 1 Found Property Report and 5 Public Assist Requests between 10/07/15 and 10/08/15.

Occurred on 10/09/15 at 4:16 AM.  JESTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Burglary of a Habitation: Two residents, of a 2nd floor dormitory room, reported an unknown subject entered their unsecured room while they were out and stole one of the resident’s driver’s license and a total of $240.00 in cash from their residence hall room.

The student was found sitting on a couch in the south lobby. Based on the appearance of the front of his britches, there was speculation that the student had mistaken the couch for a toilet. The student admitted to having consumed four shots of vodka earlier in the evening. The student was originally turned over to his sober, responsible, roommate who agreed to come take care, custody and control of him. A mere thirty minutes later, the roommate’s lack of understanding about what taking “care, custody and control” of someone meant became apparent when a second report came in about the same student being ill in a 14th floor men’s restroom. Austin-Travis County EMS also responded and determined the student was intoxicated to the point he needed to be transported to a local hospital for the treatment of alcohol poisoning. Occurred on 10/09/15 at 12:56 PM.  JESTER WEST, 201 East 21st Street  Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor / Possession of Fictitious License: UT officers were summoned to the south door of the residence hall to investigate a report of a subject trying to enter the secured doors. Upon arrival, the officers found a non-UT subject who complained a UT student agreed to pay him $20 for a ride to the residence hall. When they arrived, the student exited the vehicle and entered the residence hall without making good on the payment. Not being a pay-for-hire driver, the subject was advised a lack of payment would be a civil issue and directed to leave. The student, who was under the age of 21, was found slumped over the waste management device located inside 1st floor restroom. The student admitted to having consumed four shots of whiskey and several beers. Austin-Travis County EMS checked the student and determined he was not in need of medical attention. When asked how he obtained the alcoholic beverages, the student produced a fictitious driver’s license that purported him to be over the age of 21. Occurred on 10/09/15 at 12:56 AM.   SAN ANTONIO PARKING GARAGE, 2420 San Antonio  Assist Outside Agency (2 counts): Two non-UT subjects were found loitering in the alleyway, located on the south side of the parking garage, near a posted “No Trespassing” sign. One of the two subjects appeared to have been consuming alcoholic beverages. Warrant checks showed both subjects had outstanding outside agency arrest warrants. One subject’s warrant was for “aggressive solicitation,” while the other subject’s warrant was for “camping in a public place.” Both subjects were taken into custody. Occurred on 10/08/15 at 8:55 PM.  WALTER WEBB HALL, 405 West 25th Street  Criminal Trespass: A non-UT subject was found sleeping on the east side of the building, just feet from a posted “No Trespassing” sign. The subject was known to the officer as the same officer had issued the same subject a written criminal trespass warning citation at the same location and at nearly the same time of day just two days prior. The officer awakened the subject and promptly took him into custody. Occurred on 10/08/15 at 7:36 AM.  2300 Robert Dedman  Driving While License Invalid / Possession of Marijuana / Possession of Drug Paraphernalia: A UT staff member was stopped for driving the wrong way on a one-way roadway.

The source of the odor was determined to be a metal grinder containing .02 ounces of marijuana and several small remnants of hand rolled marijuana cigarettes that contained a total of .04 ounces of marijuana. A driver’s license check showed the subject was also operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended. Occurred on 10/09/15 at 2:07 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 22 Alarm Reports, 10 Traffic Violations, 3 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 6 Suspicious Activity Reports, 2 Accidental Damage Reports, 1 Stuck Elevator and 6 Public Assist Requests between 10/08/15 and 10/09/15.

The investigation revealed the student had consumed alcoholic beverages with two non-UT guests in her 11th floor room. The two non-UT guests advised the officer they moved the student into the hallway after she “passed out” for fear she may evacuate her stomach contents inside the room.

The subject stated that while she was soliciting money from pedestrians, she was approached by a subject who stated his name was “Sam” and claimed to be a business major. “Sam” made small talk before making a suggestion as to how the reporting person could get money and displayed something that was also described as “small.” The reporting person demanded money from “Sam” or she would call the police. “Sam” quickly fled from the area.

Occurred on 10/10/15 at 5:54 AM.  1900 Speedway  Criminal Mischief / Theft: A UT Parking and Transportation Services employee approached three vehicles that were stopped on the side of the roadway but not in parking spaces.

Occurred on 10/09/15 at 9:50 PM.  31st Street and Speedway  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was reported as being “unconscious” near the intersection.

Although the subject claimed he had not consumed any alcoholic beverages, the odor emanating from his breath and the subject’s belief that he was currently located in Cambridge, Ohio begged to differ that sentiment. The subject was found to be under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the point he was a danger to himself and others. Occurred on 10/21/15 at 10:30 PM.  JESTER CENTER, 201 East 21st Street  Theft: A black Specialized Hardrock bicycle was stolen while it was secured with a cable lock to the bicycle racks located on the north side of the dormitory.

Loss value: $480.00. Occurred between 10/21/15 at 6:00 PM and 10/22/15 at 10:00 AM  UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Attempted Fraud: Yesterday, yours truly, spoke with the parental unit of a 1st year student. The parent reported she had received a telephone call at her home residence in which the caller stated her daughter failed to complete a T-1098 form and that her daughter would be required to make a payment to avoid charges being filed against her. When the parent asked for a case number so she could validate the information provided by the caller, the caller disconnected the phone call. After learning this was a scam attempt, the parent became concerned as to how the caller got her daughter’s information; including her home phone number. The student’s home phone number, as well as other information, was listed in the UT directory. Reported on 10/22/15 at 12:44 PM. Crime Prevention Tip: This is a variant of a common scam that is frequently targeted at college students. The scammer typically obtains information about the students via the on-line directory at the student’s university. They use the information to make contact and to convince the student that an investigation had already been started by providing information about the student’s address, college major etc. I have two tips for each of you. First, law enforcement agencies typically do not call you to demand payment over the phone to avoid criminal or civil charges. If you do receive such a phone call, ask for the caller’s name, agency, and a case or reference number. Then disconnect the call and look up the agency the caller claimed to be from on the internet and contact that agency by the number listed on their web-site. My second recommendation leans more toward prevention. Simply restrict the information you make available in the university directory. At UT, you can visit http://registrar.utexas.edu/students/records/restrictmyinfo to learn more about restricting your information.   2600 Nueces  Public Intoxication: A patrolling patrol officer observed a UT student, who was under the age of 21, evacuating her stomach contents on the side of the road.

Occurred on 10/23/15 at 12:32 AM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 29 Alarm Reports, 6 Traffic Violations, 5 Motor Vehicle Collisions, 3 Suspicious Activity Reports, 3 Welfare Concern Reports, 1 Unsecured Door Report, 3 Medical Emergency Assists, and 5 Public Assist Requests between 10/22/15 and 10/23/15.

The uncooperative student refused to answer several questions, but did admit to having consumed three drinks containing tequila at a friend’s house. The student stated she was fine and demanded to go to her room. When the student stood up, it became obvious the tequila was rented not purchased. The officers stated they would escort her to her room where she would be turned over to her roommate who agreed to take care, custody and control of her. The student literally “stomped all the way to her room.” Once in the hallway by her room, the officers were fully prepared to release the student to her roommate when the student demanded to know why she was being interrogated and refused to enter her room. Just prior to being deemed a danger to herself, the student’s roommate was able to get the student to enter their room. Knowing when to say “when” was obviously an issue for this student in more ways than one.

The non-UT driver stated the passenger had been hit in the head during the altercation. Austin-Travis County EMS arrived in time for the unconscious subject to regain consciousness and pick up the fight he had passed out during.

The investigation revealed the bicycle had been stolen the previous night from an apartment complex near the area, one of the debit cards was believed to have been stolen from the mail and two others were stolen during a recent off-campus burglary of a motor vehicle. The subject was also found to have eight outstanding outside agency arrest warrants for public intoxication (x2), sit or lying on a sidewalk (x2), aggressive panhandling, camping in a public place, pedestrian crossing against the light, and disorderly conduct.

Upon stopping the vehicle, the officer observed the non-UT driver was vigorously attempting to awaken the non-UT front seat passenger of the vehicle. Once the officer awoke that passenger, he began to develop the belief that person was inebriated. All of the sudden, the driver no longer wished to assume care, custody and control of the intoxicated subject. The front seat passenger became most argumentative and told the officer,”Ain’t no way I am being detained.” Despite his best argument, the subject was indeed being detained until the point he was arrested. With that, the subject accused the officer as being “Drunk as” h-e-double hockey sticks and refused to get into the back of the patrol car. Several officers were needed to place the subject into the patrol car. Several more officers were needed to remove the subject form the patrol car at the local lock-up.

The student stated on 10/27/15 at approximately 11:30 AM she received a phone call from a subject who called himself, “Johnny.” The caller told the student there was an arrest warrant out for her arrest for non-payment of taxes. The caller then provided personal information about the student to increase her confidence that there was indeed an investigation and arrest warrant for her. The caller remained on the phone as the student made several different cash transfers to three different people on 10/27/15. The caller told the student she still owed money and would need to make transfers the following day or face being arrested. On 10/28/15 the student made two other cash transfers to two of the same three people. In all, the student transferred $5,608.00. Reported on 10/28/15 at 4:07 PM.   UNIVERSITY POLICE BUILDING, 2201 Robert Dedman  Theft: The parent of a UT student contacted the UT Police Department to report her daughter may have been arrested or abducted. An extensive investigation revealed the student had received a phone call from someone claiming to be a federal agent and told the student she would be arrested if she did not pay $3,000.00 in “student taxes.” The caller directed the student to remain on the phone while the financial transactions were completed. The student was able to contact her roommate by text during the phone call. The text messages advised her roommate she was being arrested and asked her roommate to call her mother and have the funds wired to her account. The student’s mother and a network of pseudo sleuths were able to determine the student had not been arrested. Knowing her daughter had not been arrested and being unable to contact her daughter, the mother of the student then became fearful her daughter had been kidnapped. The Austin Police Department and The University of Texas Police Department jointly worked on the case and quickly found the student at a nearby wire transfer business. The investigation revealed the student had not been arrested or kidnapped, but had fallen victim to a popular scam in which the thief calls students and threatens them with arrest for non-payment of taxes and demands they provide a money order or prepaid cash card information to avoid arrest. While the money had been transferred, the student was able to stop the transfer before the thief was able to claim the cash. Occurred on 10/27/15.  Crime Prevention Tip: This report illustrates the possible negative impacts of this scam. These crimes don’t just take money from the victims; they instill fear in the victim and in those who care for the victim. In recent cases (including the prior entry), the caller has placed the call from the following number: (202) 864-1380. The 202 area code is a Washington, D.C. area code which could make the victim believe even more that the caller is a “federal officer.” A simple internet search reveals calls form this number is a scam. There are two things I want everyone to consider doing to prevent this scam. First, forward this entry to those you know. If you work in a department that has an e-mail list for students, please check on your ability to forward this information. The more people know that this is a scam the less likely it is to be perpetrated. The second thing I encourage all of our students to do is visit the UT Registrar’s webpage and restrict the information you allow to be posted by directory services. There is strong evidence to show the thief is obtaining student telephone numbers, local and permanent addresses, e-mail addresses, academic major and student year from on-line directory services. To restrict your directory information visit: http://registrar.utexas.edu/students/records/restrictmyinfo   UNIVERSITY TEACHING CENTER, 105 West 21st Street  Theft: A white Trek bicycle was stolen while it was somewhat secured with a u-lock to the bicycle racks located on the north side of the building. The u-lock was still secured to the bicycle rack when the owner returned to retrieve his bicycle. It is believed the u-lock was not fastened properly around the bicycle. Loss value: $500.00. Occurred on 10/28/15 between 6:30 PM and 8:19 PM.  The University of Texas Police Department responded to 41 Alarm Reports, 1 “Police Help” Callbox Activation, 1 Fire Alarm Activation, 13 Traffic Violations, 7 Suspicious Activity Reports, 4 Unsecured Door Reports, 2 Medical Emergency Assists, 3 Welfare Concern Reports, and 9 Public Assist Requests between 10/27/15 and 10/29/15.

At the time of the arrest, the owners of the property could not be identified or contacted. Occurred on 11/20/15 at 9:44 AM. Crime Prevention Tip: In this case, the subject was in possession of property that was not likely his. Unfortunately, because the owner(s) of said property could not be identified, the police had few options. The officers could confiscate the property that they could confirm did not belong to the subject. Because the owner(s) of some of the property could not be determined, the officers had no choice but to let the subject keep that property. Cases like this happen all the time. There are a few considerations I have for you. First, engrave your state issued driver’s license or identification card number on your property. If you have a Texas driver’s license or ID card, simply engrave your property with “TX” and the eight digit number (TX 01234567). You can borrow an engraver free of charge from the UT Police Department to engrave your property. If the property in this case had been engraved, the officer could have run a driver’s license check on the number and return the property back to the owner.  Another consideration is registering your property on the UT Police Web Page. That web page is https://login.utexas.edu/login/cdcservlet?goto=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.utexas.edu%2Fpolice%2Fproperty%2F&RequestID=2115554267&MajorVersion=1&MinorVersion=0&ProviderID=https%3A%2F%2Futweb-wb-z1-p01.its.utexas.edu%3A443%2Famagent%3FRealm%3D%2Fadmin%2Futweb-realm&IssueInstant=2015-11-23T06%3A56%3A41Z  The registration captures the make, model, color and serial number of your electronic items. The serial number is a big part of identifying lost and stolen property.  2300 Red River  Public Intoxication: A non-UT subject was observed stumbling and staggering to the point of entering the roadway on two occasions.

Campus Watch: Below is a summary of campus activity reported to or observed by The University Police Department Patrol Officers between Friday, 12/18/15 and Monday 12/21/15.  The Best of 2015 I have fielded dozens of nominations for the Best of list for 2015. While I was not able to track down every nomination, I have compiled a list of what you, the reader’s, liked the most (see attached). I added one at the end of the list that meant a great deal to me this year.   Sadly, my annual favorite did not make the list this year – because, well, it didn’t happen. My all-time favorite has always been, “There were no crimes reported to or observed by the UT Police Department.” Hopefully, that will be a common entry in 2016. Please enjoy the Best of List and reply back with what you think should be in the top ten. We will send out the top ten for 2015 in early 2016.    INNER CAMPUS DR AND SPEEDWAY ST  Theft: A UT student reported their bicycle stolen from the rack at this location.

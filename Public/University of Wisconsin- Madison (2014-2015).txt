CRIME ALERT: Theft Case; UWPD Seeks Public’s Help
Incident type: Theft
Location/address: Memorial Union
Description: The UW-Madison Police Department is investigating a theft case, and is looking for the community’s help in solving the crime.
On Wednesday, February 5, a UW-Madison student was studying with friends at the Lakefront on Langdon Café (Memorial Union), when a man walked up to the table she was seated at, grabbed her laptop computer, and ran.  He said nothing, the victim said nothing and didn’t put up a fight – rather, the suspect simply stole the laptop and ran off.
Witnesses nearby told UWPD they had seen the suspect about 20 minutes earlier acting suspicious, and possibly scoping out the area for a potential target.
While there was no weapon or implied threat, the bold nature of this crime is concerning – and UWPD reminds the campus community to always be aware of your surroundings, and immediately call police if something or someone seems suspicious.
The case remains under investigation – and UWPD investigators are hoping the photos below might help locate the suspect involved.  He’s described as a black male, thin build, wearing a green camouflage jacket with red hooded sweatshirt under the jacket, blue jeans, dark shoes, and a striped red white and black stocking cap.  A possible second suspect is described as a Latino male, heavyset build, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt, dark jeans, and white shoes.
If you have any information about this crime, call UWPD at (608) 264-COPS.

Incident date
December 13, 2013, 12:00 AM
Incident type
Theft
Location/address
SWAP - 1061 Thousand Oaks Trail, Verona, WI 53593
Description
A former UW-Madison employee has been charged with felony theft, after a months-long police investigation by the UW-Madison Police Department.
Sonja Dedrick, 42, of Verona, was charged after an investigation determined she had embezzled $144,642 from UW SWAP (Surplus With A Purpose), where she was a Senior Accountant.
In late September, SWAP employees noticed approximately $45,000 missing from accounts – that triggered a broader audit, which led to the discovery of the larger amount that had been stolen.
Dedrick admitted to police that she stole the money over the last year to pay bills. All of the money has since been recovered.
UPDATE (3/12/14): On March 7, 2014, Sonja Dedrick pleaded guilty in Dane County Court to felony embezzlement — she was sentenced to 80 days in jail and three years probation. Dedrick has since paid back all missing funds to the University.

Alcohol Issues a Big Problem Last Weekend
Incident type: Alcohol
Location/address: UW-Madison Campus
Description
While there was lots of excitement in the air as the UW Men’s Basketball team headed into the Final Four, it brought out some of the worst alcohol-related issues so far this year.
Before tip-off on Saturday night, the UW-Madison Police Department had already transported several students to detox — one of them had a preliminary BAC of .37.  The 21-year old was found unconscious in a restroom at Gordon Commons. It took officers over a minute to try and wake him up — even then, he was unaware of his location, the date, time, etc.  When asked what day it was, he responded, “A.M.”
The two pre-game detox conveyances made up ten total detox trips for UWPD from Friday through 1:00 A.M Sunday morning – seven were UW-Madison students.
In all, UWPD officers issued 13 underage alcohol citations.  One person, not affiliated with the UW, was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated.
Many of the alcohol-related incidents officers witnessed this weekend were extremely dangerous, and could have led to severe injury or death.

UWPD Responds to Disturbance at Residence Hall
Incident type: Disturbance
Location/address: Sellery Hall
Description:
At approximately 4:20 p.m., UW-Madison Police officers were called to Sellery Hall, 821 W. Johnson Street, for reports of an individual who was being disruptive. He was asked several times by Housing staff to leave, but he refused.
Upon arrival, officers located the man, a UW-Madison student, and worked to assess the situation. At that point, the man became very combative and violent, and showed no intention of being cooperative. After a struggle, UWPD officers deployed  a  Taser — at that point, the man was taken into custody. He was transported to a local hospital for evaluation.
The man continued his combative behavior even after he was taken into custody. As a result, a UWPD officer was injured — the officer sustained a minor injury to his hand.  The officer was transported to a local hospital for treatment and is expected to make a full recovery.
No information is available at this time as to the identity of the man in custody, or what charges he faces.
*** UPDATE ***
The suspect in this case has been identified as Shane Franke, a UW-Madison student. He has been tentatively charged with Battery to a Police Officer, Disorderly Conduct, and Resisting Arrest.

Former UW Nurse to be Charged with Diverting Drugs, Reckless Injury
Case number:14-00815
Incident type: Drugs
Location/address: UW Hospital
Description
On March 13, 2014, the UW-Madison Police Department was contacted by officials with UW Hospital about an internal investigation they were conducting regarding a nurse who was suspected of stealing pain-management drugs intended for patients.
UWPD investigators learned that Stefanie A. Jones, 31, of Cottage Grove, had been diverting drugs from patients in at least 42 different instances.  A hospital investigation and subsequent police investigation revealed Jones had been accessing the morphine syringes from a secured machine, and replacing them with syringes that contained water or another unknown liquid. She then took the morphine syringes for herself.  Hospital staff became aware of the issue when a pharmacy technician noticed that red tamper-evidence caps on the drug syringes had been tampered with.
Jones admitted to hospital staff that she was diverting the pain killers and taking them for herself, and had been doing so since October 2013.  She is no longer employed by UW Hospital.
UWPD investigation concluded that Jones had diverted 42 morphine and hydromorphone syringes for herself — it’s unclear how many patients were affected by her actions.  The investigation revealed she had recklessly endangered human life, as she replaced the drugs with water or an unknown liquid — drugs meant for patient care, for pain management.
Jones was arrested on Thursday, June 12 and will be charged with 42 felony counts of Diversion of Drugs and 42 counts of Reckless Injury.

UWPD, Dane Co. Bomb Squad Investigate Suspicious Object
Incident type: Bomb Threat
Location/address: Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research (WIMR)
Description
On Saturday, June 14 at approximately 10:58 a.m., the UW-Madison Police Department received a call from a concerned citizen who noticed a beeping sound coming from a trash can outside the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research building, 1111 Highland Avenue.  A UWPD officer with an explosives-detecting K9 arrived on scene — he heard the beeping from a distance, and decided it was too dangerous of a situation to investigate.  As a result, the Dane County Bomb Squad responded.
After examining the contents of the trash can, the beeping object was identified —  UWPD K9 Odin went to work, but could not detect any explosives. It was determined that the object — which was some sort of small electronic device — was harmless.
Highland Avenue was closed temporarily to traffic and bus routes — at approximately 11:30 a.m., the street was reopened.

Man Rescued from Lake Mendota Near UW Lakeshore
Incident type: Lake Rescue
Location/address: UW-Madison Lakeshore
Description
At approximately 7:00 p.m., the UW-Madison Police Department, along with the City of Madison FireDepartment, responded to the Lake Mendota shoreline, near Porter Boathouse, for a report of a man struggling in the water.
According to Madison Fire, a fisherman helped the man get to shore. It was determined that the man was intoxicated, and had planned to swim across the lake. He reached a buoy and realized he couldn’t make it — he then started yelling for help.
The man was not injured — the UW-Madison Police Department transported him to detox, because of his level of intoxication.
Swimming in a natural body of water can always be dangerous because of changing water conditions.  The public is reminded:
	•	Never swim alone or after using alcohol.
	•	Never swim at night. Rescues in the dark are nearly impossible.
	•	Whenever you are near or in a natural water environment, look out for hazards below the water which you cannot see, aquatic life/vegetation that could entangle feet or make swimming difficult, and sudden lake bottom drop-offs that can rapidly change water depth.

Man Scammed, Lost Thousands in Fraud Case
Incident type: Fraud
Location/address: UW-Madison Campus
Description
On Tuesday, July 29, an Eagle Heights resident contacted the UW-Madison Police Department to report a fraud case.
The victim told UWPD he received a phone call from a Delaware phone number — the man on the other end of the line identified himself as “Jimmy Arthur” from the “Federal Tax Department.” The caller told the victim that there was a warrant out for his arrest because of unpaid state taxes.  He told the victim if he hung up, the “Madison area authorities” would arrest and deport him. The caller claimed he owed $1,320 in taxes, and needed to pay the amount immediately.
According to the victim, the caller then “transferred” the him to a woman, who instructed him to travel to numerous ATM’s and convenience stores in the Madison area to withdraw money and purchase pre-paid cash cards.  The caller stayed on the phone with the victim the entire time. Eventually, the victim gave the caller the numbers on the purchased cash cards, which the caller claimed “took care of the taxes.”  However, the process continued as the caller told the victim he needed to pay another $3,000 to “clear up the warrant.”  When all was said and done, the victim was scammed out of approximately $4,320.  It’s believed the call originated overseas.
Unfortunately, scams like this are all too common. As a general reminder, never give out personal information over the phone.  In addition, the IRS and other government agencies will NEVER call you and require you to provide payment over the phone.  When in doubt, hang up and call the agency that’s claiming to contact you — or call the police.

August 5, 2014, 7:45 AM
Incident at University Research Park
Incident type: Disturbance
Location/address: Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute and Clinics
Description

*** UPDATE: 8/6/14 – 9:45 a.m. ***
The subject in this case, S Jean Gibson, has died from her injuries. The case remains under investigation by the UW-Madison Police Department.

At approximately 8:00  a.m. Tuesday, the UW-Madison Police Department responded to the Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute and Clinics (WisPIC) building for a report of a disturbance.  A female, a former patient identified as S Jean Gibson, came to the building — clinic staff says she was banned from the building because of previous threats she had made.  Clinic staff told UWPD she had made statements recently indicating she had a gun, and she wasn’t afraid to use it.
Police quickly responded to the scene and learned the subject had left on foot, heading northwest into a field with heavy, thick vegetation.
UWPD along with City of Madison Police established a perimeter and started a search for Gibson. The WisPIC building was evacuated and nearby buildings were notified — but the main search area was the large field, just west of WisPIC.
As the day progressed, various search techniques were used to try and locate Gibson. The City of Madison Police Department used K9’s to track her, while the Dane County Sheriff’s Office used ATV’s. Despite the thick vegetation, K9’s were able to identify certain hotspots in the search area. At that point, UWPD made arrangements for an airplane to sweep the area — while MPD Mounted Units would respond to areas identified in the air.
Just before the airplane arrived, MPD mounted officers entered the search area to do a general sweep. A short time later, in a heavily wooded area within the search zone, MPD officers located Gibson, who had concealed herself in the vegetation. Officers had a verbal engagement with the subject. The subject was in fact armed, fired the weapon, and suffered a self-inflicted gun shot wound.
Other officers immediately responded to the area, disarmed the subject, and she was transported to a local hospital.
The case remains under investigation by the UW-Madison Police Department.
UWPD would like to thank the many agencies involved with the efforts — including the City of Madison Police Department, the Dane County Sheriff’s Department, and the City of Madison Fire Department.

UWPD Warns International Community of Ongoing Phone Scam
Incident type: Information
Location/address: UW-Madison Campus
Description
Over the last few weeks, the UW-Madison Police Department has heard from at least a dozen individuals, who have reported a phone scam that seems to be targeting international students and faculty at UW-Madison.  The phone number that appears on the caller ID traces back to either the UW-Madison Police Department or the City of Madison Police Department. However, it’s very likely the call is originating from outside the United States.
The phone calls have been similar in nature, but can vary – often times the caller identifies themselves as someone from a government tax department saying they owe taxes, or a police officer saying there’s a warrant for their arrest and they can pay money to clear their record.
In all of these cases, it’s clear this is a way to deceive people into stealing their money. The caller seems to be preying on international students and staff, often times threatening they will be deported if they don’t comply with their requests.  The caller is lying and is only trying to steal your money.
It’s important to know that government agencies, police departments, etc. will never call you and demand financial information over the phone.  Never give out personal information over the phone. When in doubt, hang up and call the agency that’s claiming to contact you, or call police.  Never get cash or supply cash to someone you don’t personally know.
In recent cases, individuals have had success telling the caller, “I know this is a scam, you’re not going to get any money, and I’m calling the police.”  Typically the caller will hang up and not bother you anymore.
If you feel harassed or unsafe, or if you worry that you’ve fallen victim and you have shared personal and financial information with the caller, please call the UW-Madison Police Department at (608) 264-2677 and ask to file a report.

Student Transported to Detox with Dangerously High BAC
Case number: 14-1558
Incident type: Alcohol - Detox Conveyance
Location/address: Lake Street Ramp
Description
On Friday, August 29 at approximately 2:15 a.m., the UW-Madison Police Department made contact with a 25-year old UW-Madison student who was reportedly alone — stumbling and having trouble balancing as he walked up a stairwell in the Lake Street Ramp, 301 N. Lake Street.
When officers arrived, they noticed the man had watery, glassy, bloodshot eyes — he smelled like intoxicants, and was having a hard time standing.  His preliminary blood alcohol content was .338, and he was taken to detox for his own safety.
As students — old and new — embark on their college journey this semester, it’s important to remember the real dangers of over-consuming alcohol.  Not only are students putting their academics at risk, but they’re also increasing their chancing of becoming the victim of a crime — from sexual assaults, to theft/robbery, battery, and more.
“This is a serious issue — not only on our campus, but on campuses across the country,” UWPD Chief Susan Riseling said.  “We’re not talking about just a couple drinks here — we’re talking about deadly levels of alcohol being consumed.”
Take control of your night and own your own Wisconsin Experience — if you choose to drink, please do so legally, in moderation, and take care of your fellow Badgers.  If a friend needs help — call for help, and don’t leave them alone.

Update: Sexual Assault Near 21 N. Park Street
Case number: 14-1484
Incident type: Sexual Assault
Location/address: 21 N. Park Street
Description
*** 9/5/14 UPDATE ***
Late Friday, September 5, 2014, the UW-Madison Police Department arrested Amory J. Waters, 21, of Fond du Lac for second degree sexual assault in connection to this case. Over the last two weeks, UWPD detectives worked tirelessly on this case — following up on leads, collecting evidence, and speaking to witnesses. The investigation led detectives to Waters– and after an interview Friday evening, investigators placed Waters under arrest.  Waters has been booked into the Dane County Jail, with recommended charges of second degree sexual assault.

On Friday, August 22 at approximately 1:30 a.m., a 21-year old woman was sexually assaulted by a stranger in an alleyway near 21 N. Park Street. The victim had been out with friends in the State Street area, and was walking home by herself when the sexual assault occurred. The suspect then fled west towards Park Street.
The suspect is described as a white male, early 20’s, 5’11” to 6’2” tall, with a muscular build, brown spiked hair, facial stubble, and last seen wearing a red shirt.
The UW-Madison Police Department is currently investigating this case. Anyone with information on this case is urged to contact UWPD at (608) 264-COPS.
Students are reminded, as a general safety rule, to be aware of your surroundings at all times — especially at night. Stay in well-lit areas and don’t walk alone.
If you’ve been sexually assaulted, tell someone – there are confidential resources available to help you. Please visit uwpd.wisc.edu/tellus for more information.

Campus Phone Scam
Crime Alert
Incident type: Information
Location/address: UW-Madison Campus
Description
Over the last few weeks, the UW-Madison Police Department has taken a number calls from individuals regarding a targeted scam. The phone calls have evolved over the last few weeks – but the basic premise is the caller identifying themselves as being from a government agency (the IRS, a local police department, etc.), and they’re demanding immediate payment information over the phone.
Most recently, parents and grandparents of UW-Madison students have been targeted; the caller identifies themselves as being with the UW-Madison Police Department, and states their son/daughter has been arrested and they must pay immediately to release them from jail. The caller’s demands included:
	•	Purchase a cash card from a convenience store – provide that number over the phone
	•	Take cash from an ATM and wire the money via Western Union, or similar service
	•	Provide your credit card/bank information over the phone
The caller identifies themselves as a police officer from the UW-Madison Police Department, and the number on caller ID appears to be coming from a legitimate UW-Madison Police Department number. THIS IS A SCAM. This a version of a larger nationwide phone scam, aimed at obtaining your financial information. The UW-Madison Police Department, or any police department for that matter, will never call someone and demand money to take care of a warrant, citation, or to release someone from police custody.  Federal agencies are involved, as dozens and dozens of schools across the country are experiencing the same scam.
Despite the call coming from a local number, it’s believed the calls are originating overseas, and that the scammers are obtaining names and phone numbers through public directories, published online. If you receive a phone call of this nature, tell the caller you’re calling the police, and hang up. It’s not necessary to actually call the police — but if you feel threatened in any way, or if you mistakenly provided financial information to the caller, please call police to file a report.

Arson Investigation
Crime Alert
Incident type: Fir e- Arson
Location/address: Lot 51, N. Mills Street
Description
Early Saturday morning, at approximately 4:00 a.m., the UW-Madison Police Department responded to a report of a vehicle on fire in Lot 51, on North Mills Street.  UWPD officers responded, along with the city of Madison Fire Department. The fire was quickly extinguished.
Officers have determined that someone lit a portable toilet on fire — that fire quickly spread to another portable toilet and a nearby vehicle.  Both portable toilets were destroyed, and the vehicle was badly damaged. A nearby UW Fleet vehicle also sustained some damage from the heat of the fire.
About an hour earlier, the City of Madison responded to a call of a trash cal lit on fire approximately two blocks away from the N. Mills Street incident. It’s unclear if the two incidents are related.
UWPD is looking for witnesses or anyone who might have information about the incident — they’re asked to call (608) 264-COPS.
General fire safety reminders:
	•	Immediately report any fire to Madison Fire and UWPD by calling 911.
	•	Report any suspicious behavior by calling 911. In case of fire, have an escape plan and discuss it with housemates.
	•	Do not try and extinguish large, dangerous fires alone — call 911.
	•	Do not stop to collect belongings and do not re-enter a burning building for any reason.

Dodgeville Man Arrested for Third OWI, Fleeing, Resisting
Case number: 15-01281
Incident type: Alcohol - OWI
Location/address: South Park Street, at Chandler Street
Description
A Dodgeville man is in custody after fleeing from police – and then asking the wrong person for a ride home.
On Saturday, August 22, at approximately 2:05 a.m., a UW-Madison Police officer observed a vehicle driving erratically near the Kohl Center. The driver, later identified as Sean M. Riemenapp, 21, was speeding and came close to running other vehicles off the road.
Riemenapp was stopped at S. Park Street and Chandler Street – the officer noticed he was slurring his speech and smelled like alcohol. After failing a field sobriety test, with a .14 BAC, Riemenapp was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated. While being handcuffed, Riemenapp escaped from the officer’s grasp and took off running. A foot pursuit and search began – with help from a Madison Police K9 unit – but Riemenapp couldn’t be located.
At approximately 4:45 a.m., Riemenapp tapped on the window of a vehicle in Middleton, and asked the driver for a ride home. Unfortunately for Riemenapp, the vehicle was a squad car, and driver was an on-duty Middleton Police officer – the officer recognized Riemenapp, based on a description UWPD had broadcast to local police departments in the attempt to locate him. Middleton Police transported him to UWPD, where he was placed under arrest.
Riemenapp was booked into the Dane County Jail on charges of third offense OWI, fleeing, and resisting arrest.

UWPD Arrests Man for Battery
Incident type: Battery
Location/address: East Campus Mall
Description
On Thursday, September 10 at approximately 2:20 p.m. the Madison Police Department was made aware of a male subject throwing punches and acting odd in the area of State Street and N. Park Street.  The subject attempted to hit the person twice who was calling 9-1-1.  The subject was following the caller down Park Street toward Grainger Hall on the UW Madison Campus. Both the Madison Police Department and UW—Madison Police Department sent officers to the area in an attempt to locate the subject.
At approximately 2:45 p.m., the UW-Madison Police Department received a report from a UW-Madison student who said he was struck by a male subject matching the description of the earlier call.  The second call was in the area of the Education Sciences Building (1025 W. Johnson Street.). The victim provided an excellent description of the suspect and last direction of travel.
Based on the description the suspect, Ezekiel Golden, 47, was located at the intersection of Johnson Street and East Campus Mall. Officers observed Golden stopping traffic and hitting vehicle hoods with his hands. He left the intersection and went to East Campus Mall, where dozens of students were going to and from classes.
As an officer approached Golden, he became physically and verbally aggressive — stating he was going to hurt the officer; the officer retreated.  Officers tried to calm Golden down verbally — he refused to listen and was warned about being Tasered. Golden did not follow commands, did not stop, and continued to advance on the officer. Another officer then deployed his Taser. Golden was taken into custody — he refused medical treatment at the scene, but was transported to a hospital as a precaution.
Golden was arrested and booked into the Dane County Jail on battery charges.
UWPD is familiar with Golden — he has a long history of violence and aggression, especially towards law enforcement.  Also in the past several weeks, officers were aware that Golden had been involved in many different strange encounters including walking into traffic attacking vehicles and was not taking his prescribed medication.  Officers believed based on this information that Golden may have been in a state of mental health crisis.

Sexual Assault Reported Off Campus
Crime Alert
Incident date: September 19, 2015, 12:00 AM
Incident type: Sexual Assault
Location/address: Off Campus UW-Madison Fraternity
Description
In the early morning hours of Saturday, September 19, a sexual assault was reported to have occurred in an off-campus UW-Madison fraternity house. Bystanders reportedly intervened to stop the situation.
The reported assault was disclosed to a Campus Security Authority – and not to law enforcement. Therefore, there is no current criminal investigation.
Sexual assault is never the fault of the victim. While nothing is failsafe, here are some suggestions everyone should consider:
	•	Make sure you have consent. Consent is a clear and freely given yes, not the absence of a no.
	•	People who are incapacitated by alcohol or drugs cannot give consent. Signs of incapacitation may include—but are not limited to—throwing up, slurring words, stumbling, or not being able to remember conversations.
	•	Be active in supporting a safe and respectful community. If you see others engaging in disrespectful or inappropriate actions, speak up and get involved, or contact someone else to assist.
	•	If you witness something that doesn’t feel right, you can help by getting involved. Check-in and ask, “Hey, do you know this person?” or, “Are you OK?”
	•	When you go out, consider going out as part of a group. People tend to step in and intervene in situations when they have friends that will back them up.
	•	Be alert to people pressuring you or others to use alcohol or other drugs. Do not pressure others to drink or use drugs.
	•	Use and encourage others to have a companion or a safe means of getting home, i.e., a trusted friend, taxi, or SafeWalk at 608.262.5000.
If you’ve been sexually assaulted, tell someone – there are resources available to help you. Please visit uwpd.wisc.edu/tellus and www.uhs.wisc.edu/evoc for more information, and for information about preventing sexual violence.

Battery Investigation at Camp Randall Stadium
Case number: 15-1760
Incident date: October 3, 2015, 2:30 PM
Incident type: Battery
Location/address: Camp Randall Stadium
Description
The UW-Madison Police Department is seeking the assistance from fellow Badgers fans in a battery case, in which a 15-year-old local Iowa Hawkeyes fan was attacked by a Badger fan at the end of Saturday’s football game at Camp Randall Stadium.
At approximately 2:30pm, a 15-year-old boy — wearing Iowa Hawkeyes gear — was exiting Camp Randall Stadium with friends, when an unidentified man punched him in the face. The victim told officers he was mildly teasing his friend — a Badger fan — about the Iowa win, when the suspect approached him and struck him in the face. The attack was unprovoked, and the suspect fled into the crowd exiting the stadium.
The suspect information is minimal: male, 20-25 years old, wearing a red shirt and jeans, last seen exiting the upper deck via the south stadium ramp.
The 15-year-old victim suffered bruising and scratching to his face, but wasn’t seriously injured.
We pride ourselves, as Badger fans, to be respectful to all fans — great sportsmanship is what makes Badger game days one of the best and most well-known traditions in the country. We can’t and will not stand for this behavior. Further, if you see a fan who’s out of line, contact police immediately and provide a good description.  We strive to provide and maintain a safe and enjoyable experience for ALL fans at Camp Randall Stadium.
We’re asking our fellow Badgers who have any information about this incident to contact the UW-Madison Police Department at (608) 264-2677. Your tip can remain anonymous.
